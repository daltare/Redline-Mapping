### Exploring the Legacy of Redlining in California with Open Data and Open Source Tools

Analyzing and understanding the history and systems and that influenced present-day environmental conditions in California can help inform the work that the State Water Board and other CalEPA agencies do to as we work towards the goal of ensuring equitable access to clean air, water, and land for all Californians. Recent efforts by researchers to uncover and digitize historical records have made this work increasingly possible, by enabling us to better identify historically marginalized communities and assess how conditions in those communities have varied over time relative to other areas.

As one part of this effort, CalEPA staff combined [mortgage lending risk maps](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=&text=intro) created by the federal government in the 1930s – which were part of a process now commonly known as Redlining – with the indicators of present-day pollution burden and population vulnerability that are measured by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment’s (OEHHA) [CalEnviroScreen 3.0](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen) tool. By combining these datasets, we can explore whether there are common geographic patterns between historical Redlining practices and current environmental, public health and socioeconomic conditions, and ultimately begin to investigate the relationship between institutional racism and present-day environmental injustices.

This work is an ongoing effort, and by using open data and open source tools we hope to encourage others to build on our work or adapt it to their local context, as well as provide transparency in our approach. The talk will discuss the datasets and tools used in the analysis, the multiple formats being developed to present the work to different audiences, and considerations for how to interpret the results and potentially use them to inform future work both within and beyond the CalEPA.
