## Background -- Redlining

### Some Standard Definitions: 

- Wikipedia: "the systematic denial of various services or goods by federal government agencies, local governments, or the private sector either directly or through the selective raising of prices" <sup>1</sup>

--

- Google / Oxford Languages: "refuse (a loan or insurance) to someone because they live in an area deemed to be a poor financial risk (example: 'banks have redlined loans to buyers')" <sup>2</sup>

--

<br>
### In the context of this project, "Redlining" refers to a specific, well documented practice...

## Background -- History

#### Zoning (Los Angeles): 

> "a black community became established in the South Central area of the city in the 1940s. The neighborhood had some industry, but its **<u>nonresidential character was more firmly entrenched when the city began a process of 'spot' rezoning</u>** for commercial or industrial facilities. **<u>Automobile junkyards became commonplace</u>** in the African American neighborhood. In 1947, an **<u>electroplating plant explosion</u>** in this newly developing ghetto killed five local residents (as well as fifteen white factory workers) and destroyed more than one hundred homes.
>

<!-- quote - Rothstein page 55 -->

---

## Background -- History

#### Zoning & Redlining: 

> "when the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) developed insured amortized mortgage as a way to promote homeownership nationwide, **<u>these zoning practices rendered African Americans ineligible for such mortgages</u>** because banks and the FHA considered the existence of nearby rooming houses, commercial development, or industry to create risk to the property value of single-family areas. **<u>Without such mortgages, the effective cost of African American housing was greater than that of similar housing in white neighborhoods, leaving owners with fewer resources for upkeep</u>**. African American homes were then more likely to deteriorate, reinforcing their neighborhoods' slum conditions."
>

<!-- quote - Rothstein page 50 -->

--

> "zoning... attempted to protect white neighborhoods from deterioration by ensuring that few industrial or environmentally unsafe businesses could locate in them. Prohibited in this fashion, **<u>polluting industry had no option but to locate near African American residences</u>**."

<!-- quote - Rothstein page 56-57 -->
