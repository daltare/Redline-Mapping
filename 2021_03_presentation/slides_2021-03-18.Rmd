### Background -- What is Redlining?

#### Some Standard Definitions: 

- Wikipedia: "the systematic denial of various services or goods by federal government agencies, local governments, or the private sector either directly or through the selective raising of prices" <sup>1</sup>

--

- Google / Oxford Languages: "refuse (a loan or insurance) to someone because they live in an area deemed to be a poor financial risk (example: 'banks have redlined loans to buyers')" <sup>2</sup>

--

<br>
<br>

#### In the context of this project, "redlining" refers to a specific, well documented practice...

### Background -- Other Historical Policies

#### Zoning (Los Angeles): 

> "a black community became established in the South Central area of the city in the 1940s. The neighborhood had some industry, but its **<u>nonresidential character was more firmly entrenched when the city began a process of 'spot' rezoning</u>** for commercial or industrial facilities. **<u>Automobile junkyards became commonplace</u>** in the African American neighborhood. In 1947, an **<u>electroplating plant explosion</u>** in this newly developing ghetto killed five local residents (as well as fifteen white factory workers) and destroyed more than one hundred homes.

---Richard Rothstein, *[The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America (2017)](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-color-of-law-a-forgotten-history-of-how-our-government-segregated-america/)*

<!-- quote - Rothstein page 55 -->

---

### Background -- Other Historical Policies

#### Zoning & Redlining: 

> "when the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) developed insured amortized mortgage as a way to promote homeownership nationwide, **<u>these zoning practices rendered African Americans ineligible for such mortgages</u>** because banks and the FHA considered the existence of nearby rooming houses, commercial development, or industry to create risk to the property value of single-family areas. **<u>Without such mortgages, the effective cost of African American housing was greater than that of similar housing in white neighborhoods, leaving owners with fewer resources for upkeep</u>**. African American homes were then more likely to deteriorate, reinforcing their neighborhoods' slum conditions."

<!-- quote - Rothstein page 50 -->

--

> "zoning... attempted to protect white neighborhoods from deterioration by ensuring that few industrial or environmentally unsafe businesses could locate in them. Prohibited in this fashion, **<u>polluting industry had no option but to locate near African American residences</u>**."

<!-- quote - Rothstein page 56-57 -->

# Considerations / Limitations & Next Steps

---

### Considerations / Limitations

.pull-left[
#### Limited geographic coverage
- areas that existed in the 1930s
- only cities with population > 40,000
    
#### May be difficult to use to formulate specific policies on broad scale<sup>1</sup>

.pull-right[
> "the racial makeup of the population in redlined areas has grown and evolved dramatically over the last eight decades, and **<u>the effects of the practice have spread beyond the confines of the original maps</u>**.

> "proposals that base their remedies primarily on formerly redlined areas... exclude important Black neighborhoods and communities, and would skew impact toward a handful of large cities"

---America’s formerly redlined neighborhoods have changed, and so must solutions to rectify them. Brookings Institution, 2019.

]

---

### Considerations / Limitations

.pull-left[
#### Difficult to determine degree of causation
- lots of other factors between the 1930s and today that impact current conditions  
- many HOLC loans were made before the maps were drawn <sup>1</sup>
- distribution of HOLC loans doesn't necessarily follow the pattern you'd expect from the maps (HOLC ratings were not always deterministic) <sup>1</sup>
]

.pull-right[
> "Others have argued that the maps were confidential documents and an analysis of individual **<u>HOLC loans, most of which were made by 1936, before the “residential security maps” were completed, indicates that the agency provided mortgages to both white and minority borrowers</u>**"

---HOLC “Redlining” Maps: The Persistent Structure Of Segregation And Economic Inequality. National Community Reinvestment Coalition, 2018.<sup>1</sup>
]
    
---

### Considerations / Limitations

.pull-left[
#### Still important because...
- reflection of prevailing attitudes about race and credit risk (influences on FHA, VA, and other public and private lending programs)<sup>1</sup>
- we understand the mechanisms that lead from reduced credit access to socioeconomic / environmental / public health impacts
- helps to understand context for our work

.pull-right[
> "While the ultimate use of the HOLC residential security maps is a subject of debate, **<u>it is clear that the HOLC maps compiled the common understanding of local-level lending decision makers of the risk in the neighborhoods of their cities</u>**."<sup>1</sup>


> "Since the HOLC maps document the contemporary expert judgement of neighborhood lending risk, they provide an **<u>archive of lending risk perception</u>** ... which **<u>can help us understand the extensive reconfiguration of the U.S. urban system</u>**"<sup>1</sup>

]

---

### Potential Next Steps 

- Improve on the existing analysis

--

- Include other indicators of current conditions vs. Redline maps

--

- Incorporate other historical policies / programs that provide more geographic coverage (e.g., zoning, deed restrictions, planning documents)

--

- In-depth study of a particular local area (including other indicators & historical policies)
