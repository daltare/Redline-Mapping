### Conclusion & Next Steps

#### Informs and supports our mission to ensure equitable access to clean water for all Californians

#### Across the state, people of color are significantly over-represented in the census tracts with the highest pollution burden / vulnerability:

# Considerations / Limitations & Next Steps

---

### Considerations / Limitations

.pull-left[
#### Limited geographic coverage
- areas that existed in the 1930s
- only cities with population > 40,000
    
#### May be difficult to use to formulate specific policies on broad scale<sup>1</sup>

.pull-right[
> "the racial makeup of the population in redlined areas has grown and evolved dramatically over the last eight decades, and **<u>the effects of the practice have spread beyond the confines of the original maps</u>**.

> "proposals that base their remedies primarily on formerly redlined areas... exclude important Black neighborhoods and communities, and would skew impact toward a handful of large cities"

---

### Considerations / Limitations

.pull-left[
#### Difficult to determine degree of causation
- lots of other factors between the 1930s and today that impact current conditions  
- many HOLC loans were made before the maps were drawn <sup>1</sup>
- distribution of HOLC loans doesn't necessarily follow the pattern you'd expect from the maps (HOLC ratings were not always deterministic) <sup>1</sup>

---

### Considerations / Limitations

.pull-left[
#### Still important because...
- reflection of prevailing attitudes about race and credit risk (influences on FHA, VA, and other public and private lending programs)<sup>1</sup>
- we understand the mechanisms that lead from reduced credit access to socioeconomic / environmental / public health impacts
- helps to understand context for our work

> "While the ultimate use of the HOLC residential security maps is a subject of debate, **<u>it is clear that the HOLC maps compiled the common understanding of local-level lending decision makers of the risk in the neighborhoods of their cities</u>**."<sup>1</sup>


> "Since the HOLC maps document the contemporary expert judgement of neighborhood lending risk, they provide an **<u>archive of lending risk perception</u>** ... which **<u>can help us understand the extensive reconfiguration of the U.S. urban system</u>**"<sup>1</sup>

### Potential Next Steps 

- Improve on the existing analysis

--

- Include other indicators of current conditions vs. Redline maps

--

- Incorporate other historical policies / programs that provide more geographic coverage (e.g., zoning, deed restrictions, planning documents)

--

- In-depth study of a particular local area (including other indicators & historical policies)
