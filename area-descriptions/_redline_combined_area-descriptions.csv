Some streets not fully improved, mostly in southern part. | CLARIFYING REMARKS: The portion of this area north of 14th Avenue was platted in 1911 and was developed under the supervision of a competent subdivider. Some of the deed restrictions that have expired have been renewed by mutual agreement of owners. This part is zoned two-family residential except along Stockton Boulevard where multi-family buildings are permitted. The southern portion of the area is outside the city and is but sparsely settled. It is without deed restrictions or zoning but is not believed to be in jeopardy on this account. Improvements are predominantly small, frame, single-family dwellings of cheap to medium quality construction, which are well maintained. The area is accorded a ""high yellow"" grade."

Parts of this area might be designated as a slum district. It is zoned for Light Industry, but as yet the amount in the area is negligible. Many of the residents are employed in the S.P. R.R. yards and shops, which are a short distance south. The new U.S. Naval Base which will be locaed on Harbor Lands in the vicinity of this area, will cause increased demand for cheap multiple-family dwellings and will probably have a beneficial effect."

This area was subdivided some 3 years ago and although stimulated by promotional effort, speculative building and FHA financing has experienced only moderate activity. Adjoining to the east is an additional 56 acres awaiting subdivision which will, in time, become part of this area. Improvements, many of which were owner-built, are of good construction and attractive architectural designs. Indications are that the area is not a popular location and the necessity for the subdivision is questionable. There are a few speculatively built dwellings overhanging the market which seems to confirm the opinion that activity in the area has passed its peak.

Development of this area started some years ago but it remained largely dormant, until some 3 years ago when, under the impetus of FHA Title I and Title II financing, a period of mild activity began. Construction runs from poor substandard to standard quality. FHA loans have been mainly under Title II, although quite a few Title I loans were also built. Population, improvements and maintenance are all inclined to heterogeneity. The area occupies a low-lying but well-positioned location, and is accorded a provisional hatched “low blue” grade, solely upon the high percent of new standard quality improvements."

The eastern part of the area is outside the City of Pasadena and is under County government. Population, improvements and architectural designs are heterogeneous. Maintenance, while spotted, is generally of good quality. Many of the large old residences have been converted into boarding houses and multi-family dwellings. Apartments and bungalow courts in the area are largely of medium class. It is believed that further decline will be very gradual and it is assigned a “low yellow” grade."

This area was subdivided some 15 years ago and has made slow progress since. Lately there has been a little activity under FHA Title I financing. Construction ranges from substandard to standard quality, with some evidence of “Jerry” building. The price brackets above contemplate dwellings of standard construction. Maintenance very generally indicates pride of occupancy. Population and improvements are both inclined to be heterogeneous. Lot values are around $10 per front foot. While trend of desirability has been slightly upward for past five years, it is not believed that this will continue and the area is, therefore, accorded a “low yellow” grade."

As these stopped producing, zoning ordinances were enacted prohibiting this type of development. Since that time development has been steadily toward multi-family improvements. These cover many sizes and types and range from high-class apartment buildings to mediocre flats and bungalow courts. The area is extremely spotted and both population and improvements are heterogeneous. While some sections of this area are definitely on the verge of blight and infiltration of subversive races is more than a threat, it is thought that a more accurate reflection would be given by according a “low yellow” grade."

This old unrestricted area has long been inhabited by the servant class who were employed by wealthy families in the higher grade areas to the west and south. This district was originally much smaller but constant infiltration into other sections as deed restrictions expired has created a real menace which is greatly concerning property owners of Pasadena and Altadena. Population, improvements and maintenance are all highly heterogeneous. Many parts of the area zoned for business are honeycombed with single family dwellings, many of them of the “shack” variety, which are occupied by Negroes and other subversive racial elements.

While this area, it is claimed, will maintain its present level for perhaps 10 years, the factors of decline are present from its age and from the presence of the declining area surrounding it."

There are really two parts to the area, and it is deemed best to describe them separately. The North part is the frontage on Marina Boulevard from Buchanan Street to the Presidio wall at Lyon Street. These lots are generally 30 feet wide and overlook the Bay, with the Marina hills in the background. They face directly on either a park or yacht harbor. Although they occupy ""made land"" which was formerly part of the 1915 Exposition Site, these lots have maintained a value of from $200 to $250 a front foot even through the depression, and the average cost of the homes range from $12,500 to $20,000, with one or two a little more costly.

There are really two parts to the area, and it is deemed best to describe them separately. The North part is the frontage on Marina Boulevard from Buchanan Street to the Presidio wall at Lyon Street. These lots are generally 30 feet wide and overlook the Bay, with the Marina hills in the background. They face directly on either a park or yacht harbor. Although they occupy ""made land"" which was formerly part of the 1915 Exposition Site, these lots have maintained a value of from $200 to $250 a front foot even through the depression, and the average cost of the homes range from $12,500 to $20,000, with one or two a little more costly. The neighborhood is very popular, and owing to the limited area, it is anticipated that there will always be good demand for this frontage. The western part of the area is situated upon natural ground, and 25 foot lots predominate. The improvements consist of one and two-story, six to nine-room dwellings, with a cost range of from $7,000 to $15,000, and is also considered very desirable residential property. This part of the area borders ""C-7"" which contains a large number of three-story apartments and flats. The break from ""green"" to ""yellow"" is justified by the high character of these multi-unit improvements. This entire area is practically 95% built-up and nearly all owner-occupied by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes ranging from $5,000 to $20,000. Climatic conditions are favorable. Threat of discordant racial infiltration is very remote. Pride of ownership is high, and the demand for property in this section held better than in any other section in San Francisco during the depression. A standard eight-room house in the north part would have sold for $17,500 in 1929, $13,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $17,500.

The sub-division is somewhat remote from transportation, schools, and stores; however, with its type of inhabitants, this is not considered a serious handicap due to the fact that there are two or more automobiles in each family, with domestic help. This property, adjoining a city park, nestles on the wooded slopes of Mt. Davidson, and having an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean for a distance of 50 miles, forms a picturesque setting for high-class development. A deterring incidence affecting this area is the season of intermittent fogs and winds which is recurrent for three or four months of the year in this section. When this sub-division was placed on the market, the sites were priced from $4,000 to $15,000, according to their size and location. However, no sales were made at these values, and the maximum price obtained to date is $45 per front foot. It is believed that, with the return of normal conditions and a better planned and more aggressive-selling campaign, it will be possible to obtain as much as $7500 for some of the choice sites.

There is little or no vacancy in the area, and 80 to 90% of the property is owner-occupied. The southeastern part of the area, which is a part of ""Forest hill"", would have been included in ""A-7"" had it not been for its inaccessibility. The balance of the area is not so isolated, and schools of all grades are within walking distance; a car line and bus line traverse this part of the area, and other amenities are conveniently near. There is a fairly stable demand for property in this neighborhood. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $42.50 in 1933, and $60 now. "

The residents consist largely of business and professional men, junior executives, and better-paid ""white collar"" workers, having an income range of from $1800 to $4,000 a year. There are no racial concentrations, and the danger of infiltration of foreign elements is remote. As a whole, maintenance shows a fair degree of pride of ownership. The district is from 15 to 35 years old and has gradually developed during that period until it is now 85% built-up, the improvements consisting largely of single-family detached and row houses and bungalows of various architectural designs and types of construction. A few blocks are zoned first-residential, but the zoning is mainly second-residential, although there are but few apartment houses in the area and not a great many flats. There is 85% to 90% owner-occupancy and vacancies do not exceed 2%. There is, of course, a threat of more flats and apartments being built in the area, but it is believed that it will continue to be preponderantly a single-family residential area. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, and recreational areas are all conveniently available, and there are no detrimental influences. This area might almost be graded a ""low blue"" were it not for the considerable amount of obsolescence discernible. Loan applications in the area are favorably received by all mortgagee institutions and loans in many cases are made upon maximum terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8000 in 1929, 44500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500.
