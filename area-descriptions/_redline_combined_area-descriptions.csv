However, low percent of land improvements and many favorable factors indicate future prospects of better development. Large contiguous tracts of undeveloped land that can be purchased at acreage prices would seem to offer opportunity for speculation and/or resubdividing. That part of this area lying west of Edwards Avenue was seriously handicapped at the time it was subdivided and placed on the market some twelve years ago. The promoters offered a bonus of $50 worth of lumber with each lot, for the purpose of building temporary shelter. In many cases, the resulting shacks have been added to and improved until now there are many very small, poorly designed dwellings, showing little evidence of pride of ownership. Marketability is limited, values are problematical and the majority of residents have little financial responsibility. The area has been further handicapped by the installation of costly street improvements in 1930, which resulted in heavy property assessments and the subsequent loss of many lots and homes. These street improvements resulted in a scandal, involving several city officials. The bonds which were issued in payment, were sold for as little as twenty cents on the dollar and land values sank to the vanishing point. During the depression there were many foreclosures in this area and a large percentage of vacant houses. Recovery has been slow in a large part of the district. The city owns a reservoir site west of Tiller Avenue and south of Mountain Boulevard.

Deed restrictions provide for minimum improvement cost of $7500, architectural supervision and racial restrictions in perpetuity. Zoning is single family residential. Conveniences are not readily available. This exclusive and sequestered district was subdivided in 1925 and has been slowly developed since that time. A re-subdivision of some of the large acreage plots was recently made with the mutual consent of all property owners of the area. This will undoubtedly stimulate further development as the district is very highly regarded. Construction, architectural designs and maintenance are of the very highest character. It is not practical to designate a predominating type and size or to give price brackets as extent of home sites largely govern prices. In a general way it might be states that estates have cost owners from $25000 to $1000000. The area has been very carefully developed and population is homogeneous, and has a high community pride.

Under stimulus of easy financing during past few years there has been considerable building activity, particularly in the section directly south of Colorado Blvd. Construction is of standard quality or better. Maintenance is of good quality indicating pride of ownership. Architectural designs are pleasing and population is homogeneous and of fairly substantial means. Deed restrictions permit of multi-family structures is designated locations and there are several bungalow courts of good quality at Ave. 64 and Colorado Blvd. Adjacent to Anandale Country Club is a favorable factor. Except in section directly south of Country Club there are no uniform paving regulations. This is a particularly hard area to grade, particularly the hatched portion. However, Ave. 64 is the new high speed artery from Pasadena to downtown Los Angeles and this factor in itself has led to a stimulation of the neighborhood. Consequently, grading will be upon the basis where pattern is definitely established, and the grade assigned is “low green”.",Caution: This area is currently affected in whole or in part by an Ad valorem Tax District.

The sites run from 2/3 to 2 acres and are prices from $1950 to $5500. Improvements, maintenance, architectural designs, and charm of location are ideal, and population is highly homogeneous. Adjacent to Area C-41 on the north is not detrimental to this area as differences in terrain, and the heavy growth of walnut trees serve as physical barriers to influence. The improvements along Orange grove Ave. in Area C-41 are for the most part, old but well-maintained mansion type dwellings. The area is accorded a “high green” grade.",

This is one of the best landscaped sections of the city. Construction is of the highest quality and architectural designs leave little to be desired.

This area consists of three subdivisions: Bel-Air, Holmby Hills and Beverly Estates, all of which have been developed within the past 15 years in an orderly manner and under efficient sponsorship. This area represents, without question, the highest type of residential construction and maintenance in Los Angeles County. Homesites range in size to from 2 to 15 acres, which sell for from $7500-12500 per acre. Cost pf three recent improvements, including sites in Holmby Hills, were reported to be $80000, $100000, and $110000. It is noticeable that new construction is along conservative lines but represents the highest type of architectural skill. Extensive improvements of less pretentious character, in a price range of $25000-$35000, have taken place in Stone Canyon and tributary valleys in the past 3 years. Sales demand in the area is good. It should be borne in mind, however, that for sale purposes there is normally a high ratio of depreciation from cost prices in improvements of the mansion type.

The topography adds charm and desirability to area and the influences scattered throughout this district. The character of the area is indubitably effected by the proximity of the University which lends to it an atmosphere of “intelligencia” which is unmistakable.

Lot values, which are currently from $35 to $50 per front foot, have materially increased in past 5 years and indications are this trend will continue. Property immediately adjacent to the Emerson School, which is rapidly expanding, is considered less desirable on the account. Because of rapidly increasing population, Emerson School in southwest part is being rapidly increasing population, Emerson School in southwest part is being rapidly expanded and property immediately adjacent is detrimentally affected. Proximity to U.C.L.A is a favorable influence. It is stated that 90% of new construction has been financed with FHA Title II funds. While realizing a higher grade is a probability it is not thought that higher that a “low green” grade is justified at present.",Caution: This area is currently affected in whole or in part by an Ad valorem Tax District.

Protection is provided against racial hazards. Zoning limits construction to single-family residences. Grade schools are conveniently available. High schools, however, are somewhat distant as are also shopping facilities. Transportation along Cahuenga includes both interurban and bus service. However, this is a two and three car garage neighborhood. Any lack of conveniences will probably be shortly supplied as the area is rapidly developing. This area was first subdivided and placed on the market about 1924 but its greatest period of growth has been within the last four years. Improvements, maintenance and architectural design are of high quality; population is homogeneous and the area is increasing in popularity. The northeast section is more pretentions than the balance of the area. There are some over-improvements in the section south of Cahuenga Blvd. which gives it a somewhat spotted appearance. This, however, will be largely overcome by reason of the large amount of new construction which is takin place. The area lies in the path of the city growth and while there are some dead-end and unimproved streets, this is to be expected in an area which is in the process of development. The residential lot values run around $20 per front foot, some higher.

This is a three-car garage neighborhood and transportation is dependent upon automobiles which makes schools, churches and shopping sections conveniently available. This area was subdivided and placed on the market about 12 years ago and has slowly developed as a high class, residential section.

This area was subdivided and placed on the market 18 to 20 years ago, which accounts for the admixture of old and new construction. However, improvements are all of good quality and pleasing architectural design. Maintenance indicates a high prude of ownership and the population is homogeneous. When deed restrictions expire in 1943 there may be some encroachment of income property in that section south of Hollywood Blvd., as this part is zoned to permit multi-family construction.

Construction, maintenance and architectural design have been excellent and at present the west and northwest portions are enjoying a considerable building activity. Lot prices are largely governed by topography. Population is homogeneous and imrpovements are harmonious. Construction hazards are the cause of high building costs, but this is somewhat offset by easy financing due to large interest in unimproved property by the Bank of America and by appeal of this type of “near in” seclusive property to certain members of the higher income group.

This subdivision was platted into large home sites and placed upon the market about 22 years ago as an exclusive residential district. High pressure salesmanship was not employed and the area developed slowly but steadily. Construction and maintenance are of the highest quality. Architectural designs are harmonious throughout. Population is homogeneous and largely of the upper income group. Authorities generally agree that this is one of the best residential districts in Los Angeles. Many of the improvements are of the mansion type. Proximity of the Wilshire Country Club is a favorable influence. Owing to the constantly increasing business along Wilshire Blvd. the southern tier of blocks adjacent to it are not considered as desirable as the rest of the area. Third St. is an arterial and a traffic hazard. On account of the high percent of land improved it is not felt that the highest grade should be assigned.

One authority ventures the opinion that “Palos Verdes Estates” is one of the highest class subdivisions is Southern California. The northern part of this area (north of the Palos Verdes line) is a separate subdivision known as “Hollywood Riviera”. The characteristics of this section are very similar those of Palos Verdes Estates; however, deed restrictions have not been modified and minimum improvement requirements are so high that land improved is only about 5%, and it is not believed that a successful development is feasible until some adjustment of restrictions is made.

Much of area is still in citrus orchards and unplatted, but are said to be in line for early development. Construction and maintenance are uniform and of high character. Population is homogeneous and architectural designs are harmonious. There are a number of estate type homes, with extensive parked grounds scattered throughout the district. Both Jackie Coogan and Louise Fazenda, of motion picture fame, occupy improvements of this kind. The price bracket shown above is nominal, as home sites, which are usually extensive, vary materially in size and price.

Early development was of poor class and activity was at a standstill during depression years. With the advent of FHA financing a revival took place, but it has only been during the past few years that its full stimulus has been felt. During the earlier part of this period it is said that a number of Title I class 3 dwellings were constructed in the eastern part. This type of building has now been discontinued. Much of the earlier construction was substandard with some “Jerry” building but later improvements have been of much better quality. Maintenance is inclined to be spotted, particularly in the eastern part. Better architectural designs have greatly improved the aspect of the area in the past 2 years.

Most of the area was subsequently acquired by the institutions which financed the subdividers, and development was not resumed until the creation of the FHA. With the willing cooperation of the institutional owners and stimulus of FHA Title II financing, speculative builders became active in the area and it has been one of the “hot spots” during the past 2 or 3 years.

Availability of conveniences varies with location, from fair to good. Development of this area, which began some 20 years ago, has been irregular, then distinct waves of activity having been experienced, the last of these beginning in 1936 under stimulus of FHA financing, has been the most intense and is still under way. This intermittent activity has resulted in a spotted and more or less inharmonious aspect. New construction is of much better quality than the old, being of standard quality or better. This has had the effect of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy of raising the grade of the whole area. Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy and architectural designs are generally attractive. There are many scatter blocks located near arroyos or below steep hillsides where there are real flood or landslide hazards. However, well-conceived control projects have done much to minimize such dangers and in many cases such hazards are more mental than real. Las Encino’s Canyon properties have suffered most in the past from this menace. The area is an isolated one and, as has been indicated, is inclined to heterogeneity, and this is particularly true of the section west of Canada Blvd. The greatest activity has been in the northern part of the area and it is there that most of the multi-family structures are located. These are built in harmony with other improvements and are not considered subversive. The area as a whole and the surrounding hills are more or less heavily wooded and, while apparently not so considered, seems to offer a very definite fire hazard.

Development of this area commenced some 25 years ago and it has maintained a steady growth. The advent of FHA financing greatly increased activity and average age of improvements was lowered materially. Construction has been of standard quality or better and maintenance uniform setbacks and architectural designs of conservative types have served to retain a uniform and harmonious aspect. Population is homogeneous and evidences a high pride of occupancy. Although many improvements are growing old and accruing obsolescence will undoubtedly become apparent in a few years, it is thought that on account of its excellent location the downward trend of desirability will be very gradual.

This is a new subdivision which has been developed within the last 5 years under the stimulus of promotional effort and FHA financing. Construction meets the administration’s requirements and architectural designs are attractive although it is obvious that some of them have been built speculatively. Population, which is of the medium income level, is homogeneous, maintenance evidences pride o ownership. Favorable influences are: consistency and newness of improvements, proximity to good schools, regular “set backs” and excellent street improvements. Negative influences: proximity to industry, Southern Pacific Railway and Grand Central Airport. It also might be mentioned that high percent of home ownership is due to low equity financing and that properties are form 10% to 15% overpriced. The trend of desirability will, it is thought, be upward until promotional effort ceases and will then become static. The area is therefore accorded a “medial blue” grade.

Most streets are improved but are generally short dead-end thoroughfares emanating from Linda Vista Avenue. This area was originally a chicken ranch district, and its transition to a residential section began about 1925. Street and other improvements were financed through an issue of Ad valorem Tax Bonds, popularly known as Mattoon District Bonds. This indebtedness in conjunction with the depression retarded development, and it was not until the bond issue was refunded and the advent of the FHA that activity was resumed. Population, improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are all of a heterogeneous character. Many of the old 4 and 5 room ranch type bungalows are still in existence and in spite of many new well-constructed dwellings they give the area a spotted appearance. Distance from conveniences, poor transportation facilities and lack of deed restrictions are also unfavorable factors. Favorable influences are: large number of high grade improvements, rapid increase of better quality inhabitants, and indications of continuance of building activity. While future is somewhat enigmatic, and will not permit of first grade designation at this time, it is believed that progress has been sufficient to warrant a “medial blue” grade.",Caution: This area is currently affected in whole or in part by an Ad valorem Tax District.

This area together with “Grand Ave. District” constitutes the old aristocratic residential section of Pasadena and has a nationwide reputation. Many of the structures are 50 years old. Approximately 10% of improvements are of the mansion type occupying from one to five acres and costing in some cases up to $1,000,000. A typical structures of this kind is the 30 to 40 room residence of Phil Wrigley, which occupies the whole block on the west side of Orange Grove Ave. between Arbor and Lockhaven Streets. Many nationally known captains of fiancé and industry maintain homes in this area. During the past several years new arterial shave been constructed which greatly accelerate auto travel to Los Angeles. This has attracted Los Angeles business and professional men to this area and many new 6 to 8 room homes have been constructed. The new improvements have been largely built along Bradford and Bellefontaine Sts. In the southern part of area below Columbia St. Lot values in the area run up to $125 per front foot on Orange Grove Ave. and range from $30 to $50 per front foot in the area as a whole. These prices seem out of proportion compared with lot values in other parts of the city. While this area has many of the qualifications of a first grade area and the district will undoubtedly retain its desirability as a single-family residential section for a great many years to come, the average age of improvements and the large number which are “for sale” precludes assignment of better than a “high blue” grade.",

It is a popular district with those having business in Los Angeles, and its population to a great extent is made up of Los Angeles business and professional people. Construction ranges from standard to superstandard quality. Maintenance is of good character and in many cases mitigates age and obsolescence. Architectural designs of improvements are of great variety and this, together with a large variance in age, gives the area a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Population is fairly homogeneous, although there is a wide differential in incomes. The area contains many large old live oak trees which add to its charm and desirability. Conveniences to Los Angeles is one of the location’s chief attractions. While development has never been very active its growth has been quite steady and there are indications that its trend of desirability is still upward.

No construction hazards. It is difficult to estimate the land improved owing to fact that homesites run from 1 to 20 acres. Deed restriction shave expired upon 75% of area and more will expire on January 1, 1940. An effort to renew or extend provisions providing racial protection is meeting with success. This unincorporated territory is under County government whose zoning ordinances are inadequate. Public transportation is inadequate, shopping centers are distant from parts of area. Schools are good and readily available, and church facilities are convenient. Up to 1905 this area was largely citrus groves, and development began by the purchase of these groves by eastern people for winter homes, who replaced the ranch homes with imposing mansions. This, by and large, is the pattern of the area. Many of the old being super standard. Maintenance, likewise, shows high pride of possession. Architectural designs, as well as landscaping, are individualists and add glamour to the district. This area gives evidence of having been the “melting pot” of the upper income brackets of the nation. This is indicated by the wholesale manner in which indigenous plant life of the various sections of our nation have been injected into the decorative features of those various estates. Horticultural and floricultural novelties of all sections of the nation have been introduced into the decorative scheme of the various holdings. The evergreens of the eastern seaboard and Pacific Northwest are particularly in evidence, and on New Year’s Eve, Santa Anita Avenue is a blaze with an electrical display from these evergreens which border that thoroughfare. There is, however indications of a transition in the area. While many original owners are still residents, properties are more and more passing into control of 2nd and 3rd generation owners. This is definitely suggested by the fact that within the past few years several of these old estates, which for various reasons, have become alienated from original owners, have been subdivided; the old mansions demolished and less pretentious structures and grounds have taken their place. This is particularly obvious in the district between Calaveras and Mariposa Sts. and Santa Anita and El Molino Aves. In this district at least one old estate has been subdivided and 20 new 5 to 7 room bungalows of modern design and extra standard construction have been erected on generous sized lots to take the place of the old improvements. Demolition of another original old mansion was observed in another part of the area. What this portended could not be learned, but there is no doubt that this district is in a transition period. If imagination were allowed full sway, based upon recent developments, a 1st grade might logically be assigned, based upon residential desirability over the next 10 or 15 years. However, the area as a whole gives no such optimistic indication and, based upon present definite prospects, it is thought that all that is justified is a grade of “high yellow” with the suggestion that a future survey will break the area down into several grades. Terrain: Level with favorable grades. No construction hazards. Land improved 90%. Deed restrictions have expired but pattern of improvements are definitely established and racial hazards are at a minimum. Zoning is mixed single-family and multiple family. Conveniences all readily available including rapid transit to Los Angeles. This is the most popular and best district in South Pasadena and, although some 30 years old, many original owners are still occupants. Construction is largely extra standard.

The section bounded by as a whole are harmonious. Population is homogeneous. The section bounded by Monterey Road, Garfield Avenue, Oak Avenue and Milan Avenue would almost merit a first grade classification.

Maintenance generally indicates pride of occupancy. Population is largely homogeneous. The many old outmoded dwellings scattered throughout the area gives it a spotted aspect. There are also a number of small acreage citrus groves. It is thought that the area will remain desirable for number of years to come and it is accorded a “medial blue” grade.,

There are a few small multi-family structures in the area and two or three years ago a small number of Title I homes were built. These will not be increased as present FHA policy does not permit mixing Title I and Title II construction. Lot values run from $10 to $15 per front foot and are said to be rising. This is an attractive workingmen's area and when its pattern is more definitely formed should be broken down and regarded. In the meantime a ""low blue"" grade is accorded.",Caution: This area is currently affected in whole or in part by an Ad valorem Tax District. Individual properties should be chocked for this hazard.

No structure can occupy less than 5000 sq. ft. Conveniences are all readily available. Interurban transportation to Los Angeles is particularly good and fares cheap. This area is subdivided some 12 or 14 yeras ago but there was very little development until 1935. Since that time, under stimulus of well directed sales effort and FHA Title II financing, the district has been somewhat of a ""hot spot"". Construction is all of standard quality or better. Maintenance shows high pride of ownership. Architectural designs are attractive and harmonious. Population is homoegeneous, largely comuters to Los Angeles. Lot values are comparatively reasonable running around $20 per front foot. There are a few small multiple family dwellings in the eastern part, largely along Hellman Ave., but those blend with single-family improvements. Owing to its closeness to Los Angeles and the convenience and cheapness of transportation, the future of area seems assured. It is a favorite lending territory for all classes of mortgage institutions. The area south favorite lending territory for all classes of mortgage institutions. The area south of Hellamn Ave. is of distinctly lower quality and the improvements older and less homogeneous. This same criticism can be directed at the extreme western portion of the area along Churnwood Ave. and Westmont Dr. There is a difference of opinion as to rating of this area, running from ""high B"" to ""med.

Both restrictions and zoning limit improvements to single-family residence but provide for multi-family dwellings on Beverly Glen Road and business structures on Westwood Blvd. Conveniences are all readily available. This area was subdivided about 15 years ago. Early development was not rapid and many of the improvements that period were of questionable construction. During the past five years activity has steadily increased and currently it is a “hot spot”. In the older parts area presents a somewhat heterogeneous appearance owing to diversity of age and types. New construction, however, has minimized this defect and in newer portions improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are harmonious and of much better quality. While there are a number of multi-family structures they are of the smaller types and are confined to definite sections. This is a medium income area of moderately priced homes. Lot values range from $20 to $25 per front foot and these comparatively low prices have attracted a number of speculative builders. Mortgage institutions report highly satisfactory lending operations here. Proximity to U.C.L.A. and 20th Century Fox Studios, as well as the new Paramount Studio, should insure stability and an upward trend for many years to come.

This is a multi-automobile area and is only 5 minutes drive to Hollywood where all conveniences are all readily available.

Since its initial activity growth has largely depended upon the specialized demand of those seeking this particular type of neighborhood. The area is characterized by tis winding paved streets with steep grades and confusing locations. Construction and maintenance, while of excellent quality, is exceedingly expensive owing to excessive costs below the sill lines. Architectural designs are generally pleasing and the area is not without charm. Mortgage institutions limit their financing to high margin loans.

However, this handicap is said to be in process of being overcome. This is the best part of the incorporated town of Southgate, development of which began between 15 and 20 years ago. This area was overburdened with overlapping Ad Valorem tax districts, which retarded development until the bonds were redeemed and an adjustment made in the early part of 1938. Since then building activity, under stimulus of FHA Title II financing, has been very great, particularly in southwest portion, and a complete reversal of trend has taken place. Construction of older dwellings were of only fair standard quality, but current building is of much higher quality. Maintenance is generally of good character. Owing to a wide differential in age and architectural designs, the area has a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Population is inclined to be homogeneous. The area is primarily a higher income workingman’s district and is admirably located for such use. It is felt that the present upward trend will continue and upon this basis the area is accorded a “low blue” grade.",Caution: This area is currently affected in whole or in part by an Ad valorem Tax District.

This area is composed of subdivisions known as “Belmont Shores” and “Naples”, both being in the nature of high grade beach resort developments. However, there are an increasing number of permanent residences being built, and the area has been very active during the past 3 or 4 years. Construction is of high standard quality and maintenance is of good character. Architectural designs are generally attractive but undersized lots and irregular platting gives parts of area a crowded aspect. Owing to lack of uniformity in size, lot values are hard to estimate; based upon a 120 ft. depth they will probably range from $25 to $50, probably more for frontages on the Rivo Alto Canal, which are 30 ft. with little depth. In spite of shifting nature population gives the impression of homogeneity. Occupancy is irregular and changes with the seasons; for the same reason rentals are not constant and brackets shown above are only nominal and are upon a yearly lease basis.

It was placed upon the market some 5 years ago as a high class subdivisions and under the stimulus of a well-planned promotional effort developed rapidly. At the heyday of its activity, came the floods of 1938 and almost overnight devastated the district and, at least temporarily, blighted its future. Trapped between two major washes it suffered severely and, while actual damages to improvements were comparatively slight, grounds were washed out, in some cases practically to the front door steps of the residences, bring terror to the inmates. Much control work has been done since and it is believed that the flood danger has been largely overcome. However, the mental hazard remains and will continue until another flood season tests the efficiency of the flood control projects. Construction is of the highest character and architectural designs are works of art. Population is homogeneous and maintenance shows high pride of ownership.

This area has developed from an early beginning as a summer semi-mountain resort and has developed slowly during the past 25 years to a year-round residential neighborhood. Flood hazards were formerly a distinct retardant but, with commencement of a permanent flood control program in 1935, fear of this menace has subsides and remains largely as a mental unfavorable influence. Under the stimulus of FHA financing and its glen-like charm the area has experienced a district upward trend during the past several years. With the background outlined it can be readily seen that improvements, population and maintenance, while greatly improved, are still very heterogeneous in character. Conflicting influences make it extremely difficult to predict the future trend of this area. The heavy rainfall and many floods of last years affected this district adversely. Natural charm and conveniences to Glendale Junior College are favorable influences offsetting to some extent the negative factors indicated. Despite the popularity attained by the area in 1937 it is felt that it reached its peak at that time and that it will experience an off-setting decline which will continue. It is therefore accorded a “low yellow” grade,",Caution: this area is currently affected in whole or in part by Ad valorem Tax District. Individual properties should be checked for this hazard.

This is a new subdivision recently placed on the market by the Huntington Land and Improvement Co., who originally purchased it for a short interurban route from Pasadena to Los Angeles. This route was discarded and it lay dormant as a swampy tract until it was included in a WPA project, cleared and drained. (How this was accomplished was not researched). After this improvement the area was platted and placed upon the market as a high grade “commuters” subdivision. Under the stimulus of promotional effort and FHA Title II financing, great progress has been made in its development. Construction runs from standard or better grade. Architectural designs are individually attractive and harmonious as a whole. Population bids fair to be homogeneous. Owing to the convenience of the location to the new Los Angeles City Civic Center the area is a popular one City, County, State and Federal employees.

Part of this district was originally subdivided a number of years ago, but was far from successful. During the past 4 years under the stimulus of FHA Title I and Title II financing a number of speculative builders have operated in the area and it has been considered one of the community “hot spots”. Constructive ranges from substandard to standard quality. Architectural designs are individually attractive and usually harmonious as a whole. Population is inclined to be heterogeneous, and while owner occupancy is high, equities average so low as to threaten the economic stability of the area. Practically all improvements are being constructed by speculative builders whose profits are said to be largely derived from arbitrary increase in land prices. Sales are being effected by “high pressure” methods and there is evidence of increasing sales resistance, as many completed dwellings remain unsold. The section east of San Gabriel Blvd. appears to be the most promising part of the area. The section lying north of Chestnut Ave. west of Del Mar St., known as San Gabriel Village, adjoins a low-grade Mexican section and is engulfed by it on three sides and in addition is in proximity to the Pasadena Sewer Farm. This ambitious project is sponsored by Percy Bilton, Inc., which is aid to be financed with English capital. Informed sources very generally consider this a misplaced investment that is doomed to failure.

Lack of uniformity as to age and architecture gives the area a heterogeneous aspect. Many semi-retired people suffering from tubercular and asthmatic tendencies reside in area. The area is accorded a “medial yellow” grade. The few subversive racial elements in the city are confined and scattered throughout that portion of city shown as the business district and so zoned.,

Sewers are lacking and a majority of the streets are not yet platted. The area is some 30 years old and was developed as an orchard district. It has gradually grown into a sustenance homestead section, with lands selling from $1000 to $1500 per acre. There are few, if any, homesites of less than ½ acre. Scattered throughout are numerous poultry farms, citrus and walnut groves of various sizes. While price ranges are not feasible, nominal values run from $1800 for an 18-year old 3-room cottage and ½ acre to $6000 for an 18-year old 8-room 2-story residence and ½ acre of land. Needless to say population, improvements, age, architectural styles, construction and maintenance are all of a heterogeneous nature.

The small section of this area lying to the west of San Gabriel Blvd. is of slightly better quality, being developed in small homesites interspersed with citrus groves, but this small neighborhood suffers from dead-end streets to the west and the hazard of the high-speed traffic artery, San Gabriel Blvd. to the east.

The Japs in the area operate leased garden tracts, and as development takes place they are being pushed out. There are quite a number of third generation Mexican land owners who leased to Jap gardeners. These are pretty generally staying in district and may prove of sufficient influence to adversely affect area. New improvements, however, indicate a “low yellow” development. Since January 1939, a number of cheap Title I dwellings have been built in the area. Deed restrictions have expired; zoning is spotted, ranging from single family to multiple family, with multiple construction permitted along Venice and Washington Blvds.

Transportation limited to private automobiles. Free bus service to public schools. Churches, trading and amusement centers are remote, the nearest being Westwood Village. Originally opened up some 14 or 16 years ago as a small “cabin” type project. This area has improved considerably in the past few years and new construction is now more pretentious and of much better quality. In consequence the area is extremely heterogeneous, improvements varying from two-room cabins and shacks to new modern 6 and 7 room bungalows. There are very few improved streets and the majority shown on the map are non-existent and are topographically impossible. Platting has been largely arbitrary, contours being followed as improvements were made. In this respect lack of restrictions has been a decided detriment. Beverly Glen Blvd., the principal thoroughfare, is a through trunk highway, and well-traveled, but is narrow and winding with a number of steep grades. Lot values run from $500 to $650. Realtors state that competition of FHA Title I financing has adversely affected both price and rental values. This area, in common with other canyon developments, faces the hazards of fire, floods and steep grades. Ample forestation, coupled with rustic scenic beauty, lend charm to the neighborhood. These natural advantages, together with prospect of a favorable development of adjacent mountainous section, constitute elements distinctly favorable to the future of the area. Under the circumstances it is felt that only a “provisional yellow” grade should be accorded.",

Land improvement of 90% precludes upward trend of desirability for single family dwellings. Deed restrictions, which are far from adequate, are rapidly expiring and zoning permits multiple family housing in many parts of area. Conveniences are all readily available. This area is one of the older parts of Hollywood proper and was subdivided some 20 years or more ago. It has since been built up with 5, 6 and 7 room dwellings. Since deed restrictions began to expire the trend has been strongly to multiple family dwellings; in fact, single family dwellings in this area are considered an under-improvement. From Sunset Blvd. south to Fountain Ave. between Wilcox Blvd. and Highland Ave. there is a strong Catholic concentration which favorably influences prices and demand in that neighborhood. Proximity to industry on the south and business on the north while decreasing desirability of single family dwellings, has a stimulating effect on land values. Adjacence to the center of the growing radio broadcasting industry has been a favorable factor, particularly upon rentals. Construction is of good quality and maintenance, while somewhat spotted, is generally good. Improvements as a whole are inharmonious. Population is inclined to be heterogeneous, (15% being American born Jews) with indications of increasing number of lower class residents.

Construction ranges from good to substandard with some “jerry building”. Maintenance is very spotted, being fair to good west of Las Palmas Ave. and poor to fair in balance of area. This, together with wide range in age of improvements, gives the area a heterogeneous aspect. Population, 15 to 20% of which are Jewish, is inharmonious and indications are that it will become more so. While there are comparatively few multiple family structures, the area being preponderantly single family dwellings, the trend is toward that type of improvement. In fact, with lot values around $40 per front foot, construction of 5 and 6 room cottages is hardly practical, even at prevailing high rentals. This rental situation has been largely the result of increasing employment in the motion picture and broadcasting studios located in close proximity to the area.

Construction is generally of standard quality but there is evidence of some “jerry building” in the older residences. Maintenance is generally good, particularly in the southern portion and section west of Arden Ave., where pride of ownership is quite evident. The presence of a number of 4 family dwellings and some large apartment houses detract from the general appearance of the area. There are some scattered “island” developments where improvements are of higher quality and more desirable; these, however, are too small to segregate. Population of area is mixed and is only homogeneous in sections. The motion picture studios on the northern boundary favorably affect values and rentals. The recent location of a radio center in the vicinity has also been a favorable influence.

Construction and maintenance are of excellent character and architectural designs are harmonious. Population is of the upper medium income group, approximately 20% of which are Jewish families. The southern half is considered more desirable and commands better rentals than the northern part. This is probably on account of its proximity to the widely known “Miracle Mile” trading area along Wilshire Blvd. Land values are firm and vacant lots have sold as high as $100 per front foot. The apartment houses in the area are largely located in the southwest part. The block east of La Brea Ave. between 2nd and 3rd Sts., which has long been occupied by a horticultural nursery, is now in process of being subdivided.

This area comprises several subdivision which were placed upon the market from 1904 to 1910 and developed into part of Los Angeles’ most exclusive residential district. Owing to its very favorable location, when deed restrictions began to expire some 10 years ago, multi-family structures began to appear. The transition from an exclusive single-family neighborhood to a residential income district is proceeding in such an orderly manner and the new structures are so nearly in keeping with the neighborhood that there has been a minimum disturbance of single-family residential values. These multiple housing structures are said to be the most uniform and well-built in the city. The area is surrounded by major arterials upon which outlying business establishments are located. Third Ave., which traverses the area, while not a business street, is an arterial thoroughfare and a traffic hazard. While 8 to 10 room mansions are scattered throughout the area, practically all improvements in the district north of Third and west of Normandie Sts. are of this type. In the district north of Third and west of Normandie Sts. are of this type.

While the area is definitely declining from the standpoint of single family dwellings, it is felt that owing to the established character of the neighborhood, its favorable location and the economic stability of its home owners, it will remain a desirable residential district for many years to come.

Upon expiration of deed restrictions, construction of residential income structures was very rapid. At present the eastern part between Coronado and Alvarado Sts. is predominantly high-class multi-family structures. West of Coronado improvements are largely old single-family residences, many of which are still in original ownership. In this section construction, maintenance are of excellent quality and lend charm to the district. Third St. is an arterial thoroughfare and is a traffic hazard. Recently, vacancies in multi-family structures is said to have shown considerable increase and rentals in the higher priced apartments have dropped 10% or more.

As these stopped producing, zoning ordinances were enacted prohibiting this type of development. Since that time development has been steadily toward multi-family improvements. These cover many sizes and types and range from high-class apartment buildings to mediocre flats and bungalow courts.

Public improvements are of good character. This is an old area and was at one time the best residential section of Inglewood. There are still some original owners in the area whose maintenance shows high pride of ownership, but they are rapidly dwindling. Mortgage institutions report a high percent of repossession and losses during the depression period. The area was dormant until the advent of FHA Title II financing, since which time there has been a number of new modern 5 and 6 room dwellings built, largely along Manchester Ave. Old construction was largely of high standard quality but maintenance, except in cases of original ownership, has been only fair. Conversion of large old single-family dwellings to multiples is noticeable, and encroachment of bungalow courts and other income structures is noteworthy. Proximity to Inglewood Park Cemetery, Hollywood Race Track and small oil field, all to the east, and business expansion along Market St. to the west, are all detrimental influences. New single-family improvements have been too confined to be of any great benefit, and it is thought decline in this area will be rapid.

Development of area, which began over 25 years ago, has never been impressive, growth having been sketchy and intermittent, being similar to many farming communities in this respect. Population, improvements and maintenance are all highly heterogeneous. Improvements are practically all single-family frame bungalows. Twenty-six of the new improvements are located south of Imperial between Cherry and Yukon and were financed under FHA Title I. There are many Mexican and Japanese farm laborers in adjacent territory, whose children attend the city schools, and this is considered a detrimental influence. The community is poorly regarded by realtors and mortgage institutions, and many of them will not make commitments there. However, the town is quite evidently on the upgrade, recent construction being of distinctly better quality and design than the older dwellings.

Conveniences are all readily available and schools are outstanding. Public improvements are of good character. This is a typical “company” community, largely owned and control by the Standard Oil Co. of California, which is noted for its employee relation policies. The town’s development was coincident with the building of the modern refinery plant about 25 years ago. Originally, dwellings were largely built and owned by the company but, consistent with the policy of encouraging employees to live near its industrial activities, home ownership has gradually increased. The community suffered but little from “depression ills”, nor has it been greatly influenced by past depression building activity, although it is approved territory for FHA financing. The business district, which contains many establishments owned by nationally known concerns, is a model for neatness and upkeep. Improvements are very generally 4 to 6 room dwellings of good standard construction with high quality maintenance. Architectural designs are pleasing and population is homogeneous. Derogatory influences are adjacency to oil wells, refinery and tank farms. The beach is defiled by a large outfall sewer and oil tanker docks and loading facilities.

There is, however, no evidence of “jerry building”. Maintenance is spotted and will average only fair. Both population and improvements are inclined to heterogeneity.

This subdivision was placed on the market during the boom period of the early 20’s and lots were sold at high prices. The district suffered severely from foreclosures. However, repossessions sold readily – one institution reports 35 sales during the 1936 and 1937 with none left none left now.

In country territory zoning is inadequate. Regardless of zoning, improvements are 90% single family dwellings. Conveniences are all available in varying degrees. Some street improvements and sewers are lacking in southern portion. This large far flung district varies in age from 25 years or more between Slauson and Florence Avenues to new development from Imperial Highway to Los Angeles County line. There are many old structures scattered throughout which give the area a spotted and heterogeneous aspect. There are many blocks, however, which are uniform as to southwestern part where pattern has not been definitely established. There were many foreclosures in this area during the depression period and the HOLC Veterans’ Welfare Board and other large mortgage institutions at one time owned a large amount of acquirements. These have now, however, been largely liquidated. The area is predominantly workingman’s district and there are numerous duplexes, four family flats and bungalow courts scattered throughout. There is a threat of subversive racial infiltration (Negroes largely) in the southeast portion of area. An attempt was made to break this area down, but it is in a transition period at present, and it was not feasible. However, it is believed that in the course of time it will be necessary that this be done and will result in a number of areas grading from “low blue” to 4th grade. A large amount of FHA financing has recently taken place in the area and has had the effect of greatly increasing home ownership and strengthening its grade. Much of the southwest portion of the area occupies County territory which further confuses the situation. Construction ranges from low to good standard quality. Maintenance is generally fair.

Population within the area is homogeneous, but the surrounding country contains many Japanese truck gardeners and Mexican farm laborer families whose children attend the local schools. Proximity to oil fields on two sides, while not close, is considered an adverse influence. Lot values range from $10 to $15 per front foot.

About 10% of the improvements consist of residential income structures located in accord with tract dedication. Architectural designs of these structures harmonize with the single family dwellings are occupied by the same class of people. Threat of flood from adjacent Los Angeles River, odors from Signal Hill and Wilmington oil fields and proximity to lower grade and industrial areas to the west and northwest, are detrimental influences, which lead to the conclusion that the area is declining and is a misplaced development.

Parts of this area were platted some 20 years ago but major portion of development has taken place within recent years. This is a low income workingman’s district and both age and construction of improvements are of a heterogeneous nature. Within the past two years two subdivisions of FHA Title I homes have been started in the area, one north of Rosecrans between Stoneacre St. and Pacific Ave., where 100 homes are completed or under construction. The other is located east of Wright Rd. south of Clark St., where 50 or more new homes are in process of construction. The construction of these Title I homes is substandard and many of them are “Jerry built” in addition.
