Fresno,A1,NA,A,"This is the best residential district in the city and is occupied by business and professional men with incomes ranging from about $2,500 to $8,000 a year. It is comprised of houses ranging in cost from $4,500 to $12,000 and ranging in age from new to houses 12 years old. It may be observed here that the variance in cost range and age in a city of this size cannot be considered a detrimental influence, as it would be in a metropolitan city.  There are probably 30 new houses being built in this area at the present time, the type of construction being frame, stucco, and brick. The area is zoned for single family residences, and there is no vacancy at the present time. It is well located from the point of view of transportation and educational facilities, as the best car line in the city runs within three or four blocks of any point in the area, and the Fresno High School and Fresno State College are both within a few blocks. Here too it is difficult to define a shrinkage trend during the depression because all the lots before the depression were owned by the development company, which held them until they could be sold to people who were actually going to build on them. There was virtually no sale of improved properties here during the depression. At the present time 60 foot lots are selling for $1,000 to $1,500. There is a sharp difference in the nature of the properties north of Shields Avenue. The three blocks between Shields and Simpson Avenues is much better than the other parts, “C-1”, but as it is such a small area, it was deemed more practicable to extend “C-1” to “A-1” rather than set up a separate “blue” area."
Fresno,A2,NA,A,"This small area stands out definitely from the solid “blue” area, “B-2”, and its boundaries are well defined, as indicated on the map. It is occupied by business and professional men with income ranging from about $4,000 to $12,000. The house in the area average about $15,000 in cost, ranging from $10,000 to $30,000. They are of frame, stucco, or brick construction and most of them are two-story structures. There are two or three houses under construction in the area at the present time, and several others have only recently been completed. Thus again illustrates the fact that in a city of this type and size, with the revival of buildings, one finds areas which are already pretty well built up suddenly becoming active where there are still vacant lots. The area is practically 100% owner-occupied, and it is just as well located for transportation and educational facilities as “A”-2. The houses on this small area are, for the most part, built on 100 foot lots which are priced from $2,500 to $3,500 at the present time. The present price is about the same as was asked in 1929, and a few were sold at the low point of the depression for around $1,750. It was learned that there were only two forced sales of improved property here during the depression."
Fresno,B1,NA,B,"This is an area comprised entirely of new houses or houses under construction, the future of which is very hard to determine. One builder is developing this little section, and on it has completed two houses, costing approximately $15,000 apiece, and six or eight houses under construction which will be priced at from $6,000 to $8,000. The area is on low ground bounded on the north by a canal (which is dry most of the time), on the east and south by scattered poor developments described under areas “C-1”, and on the west by the main line of the Santa Fe. The interiors of the two rather pretentious residences completed are not very well designed, notwithstanding their pretentious exteriors. At the time of the Fresno survey, none of the houses were sold. Careful inquiry was made concerning this little development, resulting in a good deal of difference of opinion. The majority of people interviewed were unfavorable to this development because of its being on low ground and generally in rather poor surroundings, particularly for properties to sell as high as $15,000. On the other hand, in some quarters, it was felt that this development would be successful. It is perfectly possible that this small section will be one of the best residential districts in Fresno, but because of its situation and the circumstances noted, the area is hatched in “blue” rather than “green”."
Fresno,B2,NA,B,"This area is a very good residential district. The homes are fairly uniform, the population is stable and substantial, educational facilities excellent, and transportation to the business district of the best. It is occupied for the most part by business and professional people, the remaining population being “white-collared” workers. The income range is from $1,800 to $10,000 a year. In the west central part of the area is located the Fresno High School. In the eastern part of the area is Fresno State College. This college has an enrollment of about 2,500 students, all of whom are houses privately throughout this “blue” district and the surrounding “yellow” districts. A remarkable fact in this connection is that there is no indication of so-called “rooming houses” and very few other multiple unit residences in this area. The area was carefully examined on two different occasions to establish this fact. The houses in the area range from $3,500 to $15,000. The average age is about 15 years, and the range is from new houses to houses 25 years old. Construction is frame, brick, and stucco, with a variety of architectural types. The area is generally protected by racial deed restrictions. The area is zoned for single family residences except on Wishon Avenue between Howard and Weldon and between McKinley and Howard. However, there are very few multiple unit buildings in these zones. The area is about 90% owner-occupied, and there is almost no vacancy at present."
Fresno,B3,NA,B,"This area is a comparatively new sub-division known as Sierra Vista. It is occupied by small business men, wage earners, and artisans, whose incomes range from $1,200 to $2,500 a year. The houses are of generally uniform construction, most of them being four to six-room frame or stucco bungalow type of homes, costing from $2,000 to $4,000. There are a number of newly built houses here and some under construction at the present time. This sub-division has racial and set-back restrictions and also requires an average of 800- square feet for new structures. It is almost entirely owner-occupied, and the area as a whole shows great price of ownership. The hatched area to the east is comprised of fairly new houses and has several houses under construction at the present time. These houses in the main part of the hatched area south of Belmont Avenue are modest, but of good construction. The small hatched section north of Belmont and connected with “B-3” has several new houses going up and is well protected by deed restrictions. The new houses here are in a little higher cost range than those just discussed. The area as a whole is split up by a branch railroad line. This line only operated during the busy seasons of the fruit growers in the vicinity and does not seem to affect the neighborhood adversely."
Fresno,B4,NA,B,"Although the residential trend is north, this area is one of the most stable residential districts in the city. It is occupied largely by business and professional men whose incomes range from $3,000 to $12,000. The area, with the exception of one street, presents a uniform appearance, most of the houses averaging from $5,000 to $8,000. Huntington boulevard is the exception, and on this street the houses are uniform built are in a higher price range, probably averaging closer to $10,000 and going as high as $35,000, ranging in age from new houses to houses 25 years old. Here is found various types of construction, such as frame, stucco, and brick, and while the average age of the houses throughout the area is perhaps 15 years, there is at the present time a great deal of new construction. The area is protected by deed restrictions calling for a $5,000 minimum cost of construction and excluding colored races. The area is almost 100% owner-occupied, and as far as could be determined, there is not a vacancy in it. It is very hard to establish a shrinkage trend over the depression years in this area because there was almost no change of ownership; even at the low point people living here were permanent residents and were able to hold their properties. There were likewise few transfers of building lots during the depression years, but on the basis of interviews with real estate men, it was thought that a 60-foot lot on Huntington Boulevard, which would have cost $2,000 in 1929, might have been purchased for $1,400 or $1,500 in 1933, and, now that there is renewed activity in the area, the lot would sell for $2,000 or more. Concerning the limited rental property in this neighborhood, a $50 rental in 1929 probably shrank to $35 and is now back to $50. Even a $150 rental only shrank to $100, and it is now renting for $150 again, because of the nature of Fresno, its being a rather small city where there is no rapid shifting of residential districts, the relation of the lot value to the improvements of an improved property varies a great deal. For example, a house was built on half a block on Huntington Avenue costing $30,000. The owner later built a $15,000 home on half of this large tract for his daughter. In a large metropolitan area, with its rapidly shifting residential districts, either the $30,000 house would be considered an over-improvement or the $15,000 house would be considered an under-improvement. In a town of this size and nature that does not appear to be the case."
Fresno,B5,NA,B,"""B-5"", like ""B-4"", is one of the older uniform neighborhoods (average age of improvements being not quite so old as ""B-4""), containing a stable and substantial population of business and professional men for the most part. However, the income level of the people living here is lower, running from about $2,000 to $5,000, and likewise the cost range of the properties is lower, ranging from $3,500 to $8,500. The houses are of frame or stucco construction and are mostly one-story houses of bungalow type. This area has had building and racial restrictions by deed, most of which have now run out. However, it is all zoned for single family residences, and it is claimed the area will maintain its stability for some years to come. It is perhaps 90% owner-occupied, and there is no vacancy in the area at the present. Like ""B-4"", there was little change of ownership among the improved properties, and so it was difficult to define a shrinkage trend. Further, there has been virtually no activity in lot sales here for the last few years until the present time. There are very few vacant lots left, and it was felt that a good 50-foot lot in this area in 1929 would sell for $1,200, there was one actual case noted of a lot being sold for $1,000 to $1,200. While this area, it is claimed, will maintain its present level for perhaps 10 years, the factors of decline are present from its age and from the presence of the declining area surrounding it."
Fresno,C1,NA,C,"This area separates the best residential neighborhood on the north side of Fresno from the popular new suburban residential sub-division known as Fig Gardens. It includes sections on both sides of the main line railroad running northwesterly through the north side of the city. The area is occupied by American white laborers, wage earners, and some small business men with incomes ranging from $900 to $1,800. The structures in it are not uniform throughout but on the whole present a fair appearance. The houses range from almost new to some as old as 20 years, the average being about 12 years. The structures are virtually all frame, ranging in cost from $2,000 to $4,000. There is no new construction at present. The area is entirely outside of the city limits, with exception of one block, and, consequently, is not zoned, and there are no deed restrictions. The area, as a whole, is about 75% owner-occupied, and there are no vacancies at present. Normally, the vacancy runs as high as 10%. The solid “yellow” parts of the area are about 70% built up. Utilities are all in this area, and all but a few streets are paved, with curbs and sidewalks. The hatched part of this area differs in no respect except that it is only about 15% or 20% built up."
Fresno,C2,NA,C,"This area is considered a fairly desirable place in which to live. The improvements vary a good deal in cost of construction, ranging from $2,500 to $6,000. The average age is 20 years, ranging from 10 to 30 years. The houses are of frame and frame-stucco construction, and the area, as a whole reflects fair pride of ownership. The area is occupied by ""white-collared"" workers, tradesmen, and small business men, whose incomes range from $1,000 to $2,500 a year. The area is not generally protected by deed restrictions. Belmont Avenue is all zoned for business, and a few corners on Olive Avenue east of Port Camp Avenue are zoned for business. That part of the area north of Floradora Avenue is outside the city and is not protected by zoning ordinances. The area is 75% owner-occupied, and there is almost no vacancy. Normally there is from 5% to 10% vacancy. Houses which rented in 1929 for 425 to $28, rented from $20 to $22.50 in 1933, and are now renting for at least $30. The best houses in the area, which rented for $45 to $50 in 1929, shrank very little during the depression and now are renting for $50 or $55. There has been very little sales activity in this area for several years, and as there were no forced sales noted during the depression years, the exact shrinkage and present appreciation cannot be defined. There are no particularly detrimental influences affecting this area, with the exception of the railroad running northwesterly along the southwest boundary. On the other side of the railroad, however, is a fine city park."
Fresno,C3,NA,C,"This is an area which is occupied for the most part by “white-collared” workers and business men with incomes ranging from $1,500 to $3,000 a year. The houses average about 18 years in age (with the exception of the narrow strip running northwest along the railroad) and are of frame or frame-stucco construction, ranging in cost from $2,500 to $6,000. The main part of the area is fairly uniform in appearance, but the houses are not all of good construction, which, combined with the age factor, accelerated the decline of the whole neighborhood. Parts of the area are restricted by deed, and it is all zoned for single family residences except the small triangular space just north of the State College and north of Weldon Avenue. The area, as a whole, is 80% owner-occupied, and there are no vacancies at present. There is a very small normal vacancy here. In the part of this area north of Weldon Avenue there are several houses either just completed or still under construction, particularly the small triangle bounded by Weldon Avenue on the south, the railroad on the east, and College Avenue on the west, in which there are five or six houses either newly built or under construction. It is surprising that these well-built new residences are being constructed so near the railroad, with its freight cars on siding, and small businesses on the east side of the tracks. This circumstance is not felt, apparently, to be a detriment, but in grading the area it seemed necessary to penalize these new houses from the point of view of long time mortgage lending risk. The narrow strip further north contains some fairly new houses, with three or four just newly completed homes, while the proximity of the railroad and small industries west thereof penalized this narrow “yellow” strip as a whole, the nature of the improvements offer a good protection for areas “A-2” and “B-2”."
Fresno,C4,NA,C,"In this large area are all kinds of residential structures. It is an old residential part of the city where the houses range from new ones to some 50 years old and range in cost from $1,500 to $20,000. Quite a number of the larger old houses have been remodeled into duplexes or four flats, particularly in the middle of the area. The area is occupied by people of all kinds—laborers making $900 to $1,200 a year, artisans making $1,000 to $1,500 a year, small business men, a few professional men, and even some well-to-do people and retired people, whose incomes might be $10,000 or $15,000 per year. In particular, there are two small sections near the main business district of the town where some fine old homes are located, occupied for the most part by the original owners. The area is zoned for business purposes along Belmont, Divisadero, Fort Camp, Fresno Avenue, and First Street, and most of the remaining part of the area is zoned for multiple residential units, churches, clubs, etc. the area is about 60% owner-occupied, and there is scarcely a vacancy to be found. The rentals here range from $20 a month to $75 a month, and the shrinkage during the depression as about 50%. Rents are at present back to the 1929 level. The small hatched area to the north consists of small, inexpensive houses for the most part, which are scattered. There is enough variance in the age, cost, type of construction, and general lack of uniformity so that the trend of this hatched part does not appear to be upward. Further, it has adjacent on the east a very poor type of development in area “D-2”."
Fresno,C5,NA,C,"“C-5” is the hatched area in the northeasterly part of the city, occupied by American white laborers and artisans whose incomes range from about $900 to $1,200 a year. The houses already built average in age about 7 years, ranging from new houses to 12 year old houses, the part of the area west of 12th Street is developing more or less slowly and is not protected by deed restrictions nor zoning.  The houses in this westerly part are of only fair quality, and main of them towards the north are built on acreages. The easterly part of the area is a newer development which was sub-divided for the purpose of interesting small home owners. There are racial restrictions and restrictions requiring an average of 600 square feet to any new residential structure. There is no zoning, as this part, too, is outside the city. This easterly section is practically 100% owner- occupied. There have been several new houses recently completed here and there are four or five under construction at the present time. However, the new building is not of uniformly good construction, and the area shoes varying pride of ownership. Some of the houses are as old as 12 or 13 years, most of the people living here have built on from one-half to 2 ½ acre tracts and raise garden stuff and poultry, through which they secure, perhaps, half of their livings. There is a brisk demand for this type of property at the present time, but the development as a whole is uneven, and mortgage loaning should be done cautiously. There is a box factory and lumber yard in the uncolored square bounded by Belmont, Jackson, Harvey and Barker Avenues."
Fresno,C6,NA,C,"This area is in general like “C-1”. However, the people living here are mostly part of a colony of Seventh Day Adventists, having their own school. Inasmuch as the people form sort of a unit, sales, potentialities are limited. The neighborhood is somewhat benefited by having a city park directly to the north."
Fresno,C7,NA,C,"This large area, almost divided by areas “D-4” and “D-5”, is occupied by laborers, tradesmen, and a few “white-collar” workers, with incomes ranging from $600 to $2,000. The population is approximately 30% foreign born, 50% people of foreign parentage, and 20% people of white parentage. The foreign born and people of foreign parentage are generally Germans and Russians with a very slight scattering of colored races. On the whole, the people in this area are frugal and honest—good citizens. Most of them have real equities in their homes, and many of them own their homes free of encumbrance. Throughout the area the cost of the homes ranges from $800 to $2,500, with a few more substantial. The average age of these homes is about 15 years, and there are no new houses and none under construction at present. The area is zoned for single family residences except a few lots zoned for business on Fresno Avenue. California Avenue, however, is a business street. The area is about 90% owner-occupied, and there is no vacancy at present. Normal vacancy runs little more than 5%. The best part of the whole area is a triangular section northwest of Merced Avenue and east of Tehema. This was a development started about 10 years ago, and improvements are more substantial than in the remaining part of the area. However, it is an area isolated from the other desirable residential districts of the city by the main business district and by the large foreign population in “D-4”. Consequently, the area stagnated and is now declining. The hatched section east of the main part of the area contains the same type of population and the same type of improvements as other parts of the area, differing only in the fact that the houses are scattered."
Fresno,C8,NA,C,"This is an area which was sub-divided 20 years ago with low-priced lots for low-priced houses. It is now occupied by workers employed in the fruit packing houses, laborers, and a very few “white-collar” workers, whose incomes range from $600 to $1,200. Population is almost entirely American whites. The neighborhood as a whole is not uniform, and prude of ownership is from fair to poor. The houses are on average 12 years old, range in cost from, $600 to $2500, and are virtually all of frame construction. No deed restrictions remain, but it is all zoned for single family residences, with the exception of four blocks in the southwest corner which are zoned industrial. The area is 85% owner-occupied, with no vacancy noted at present. However, there is a normal vacancy of 10% to 15% because the packing houses have a seasonal peak and low point, and the factory workers move in and out. On the west the area pushes up against packing plants and other industries. On the east is undeveloped land."
Fresno,C9,NA,C,"This area includes that “yellow” portion north of “C-8” and surrounding the small “blue” area, “B-5”, the hatched area to the east and the “solid yellow” portion north of Ventura Boulevard and east of the County Hospital. The “solid color” portions are essentially the same; they are occupied by laborers, artisans, and tradesmen whose incomes range from $800 to $1,500 a year, virtually all of whom are American white. These portions are not uniform, as they contain very cheap houses, showing little pride of ownership, and a few substantially built, small houses, presenting a neat appearance. The cost range of these houses is from $2,000 to $4,000. The average age is about 12 years, ranging from new to houses 20 years old, and these is no new building at the present time. Most of the area is outside the city limits and is not protected by any zoning ordinances nor are there deed restrictions. The part surrounding “B-5”, however, is in the city and is zoned for single family residences. The area is largely owner-occupied, and there is practically no vacancy at present. The northwesterly part of the area just above “B-5” is the oldest part but has on it a few very fine homes. These homes are suffering with the general decline of the district. The portion of this area which is hatched is a sub-division which was started several years ago for small home construction but which has stagnated. The homes are scattered and not uniform in appearance. There is no new construction in any part of the area."
Fresno,D1,NA,D,"This area is located on the north side of Fresno but is separated form the best and most popular sections by a main line railroad running northwest. The area is level and is occupied by American whites entirely, most of whom are laborers and artisans, a few being small businessmen. The area is 75% built up, with the exception of a small hatched section in the northeast part of the area. The properties are perhaps 75% owner-occupied and show little pride of ownership. The houses are not uniform in type or cost of construction and range in cost from $1,000 to $3,000. The houses are of frame construction for the most part, the area containing a few stucco houses. There is no new building here at the present time, although there is some sales activity in improved properties. The streets are graded and oiled but not lighted, and there are only a few streets with curbing and sidewalks. Besides the fact that the area is not uniform and is spotted with some very poor structures, there are some small industries alone the railroad on the west, and there is a college athletic field on the southeast. All of these factors tend to make it a hazardous section in which to loan money on residences"
Fresno,D2,NA,D,"This is a section in which American white laborers live whose incomes range from $600 to $1,200. The properties are generally not well-kept, and for the most part the improvements are of very poor construction. Many of the houses are little better than mere shacks the houses range from 10 to 15 years in age, and there has been no new buildings during the last 8 or 10 years. The area is outside of the city limits; consequently, it is not protected by any zoning nor are there deed restrictions. The area is 90% owner-occupied, and there is no vacancy at the present time. The streets are graded and oiled only in part, and they are not lighted. City utilities are in, however. The hatched area to the north has the same characteristics except that the houses are scattered, and some of them are on larger lots. There is a little new building in the hatched part of the area, but it is cheap and appears to be developing into the same thing as the solid “red” part."
Fresno,D3,NA,D,"This area comprises two small sections on either side of “C-6”. The part in solid “red” are occupied by laborers and small wage earners making from $900 to $1500 per year, and the properties, most of which are cheap, reflect little pride of ownership.  In this part are mere shacks and houses costing up to $1,500, ranging in age from 10 to 30 years. This part is pretty well built up and shows no vacancies at the present time, although 5% and 10% vacancy is normal. None of the streets are paved or lighted, and only part of them are graded and oiled. There are a few colored families living in this area, but it appears there is little danger of infiltration of other colored races found in the large “red” area to the south, “D-4”. The small hatched part of this area west of Durant Street has the same kind of owners and the same kind of buildings. It differs only insofar as the buildings are scattered."
Fresno,D4,NA,D,"This large “red” area contains the most mixed population of any part of the City of Fresno. In it are found Japanese, Chinese, negroes, uneducated Italians, and a few representatives of several other races. Most of these people are laborers whose incomes range from about $600 to $1,200. The area has no uniformity in its building, and there is little pride of ownership shown. Buildings range from the cheapest sort of shacks up to fairly substantial five or six-room houses costing from $2,500 to $3,000. There are a few houses built in fairly recent years, but the average age of the property in this neighborhood is about 20 years. There are no deed restrictions to protect the property, and much of the area is zoned for business, particularly that part adjacent to the “white” section which is the main business part of the city. The area is about 60% owner-occupied, and there is about a 2% vacancy in the remaining part at the present time. The population in this area is shifting, and normal vacancy is perhaps as high as 10%. The rents here range from $10 to $30. There are several schools in the area, including a “truant” school. There was little fluctuation in values in this area during the depression, and what little fluctuation there was is hard to define because there were virtually no sales. There has been no appreciation in values here because the generally rising real estate market is outweighed by the rapid depreciation of the properties."
Fresno,D5,NA,D,"The solid “red” part of this area is about 75% built up and is occupied by laborers entirely, whose incomes range from as low as $500 to $1,200 per year. The occupants are a mixture of races—viz, Mexicans, uneducated Germans, Russians, and Italians. This part, as well as the scattered hatched part to the south, lacks uniformity entirely and reflects no pride of ownership.  Some of the houses are mere shacks, and few cost more than $1,500. The average age is 20 to 25 years, and the houses are of cheap, frame construction, or simply “board and bat”, (i.e., structures made by simply laying boards on the ground held together by bats to make the sides. The sides are simply lifted up and tied at the corners without any frame work). There is no new building. The solid “red” part of the area as far as Fig Street is zoned for business. The streets outside of the city limits are not zoned at all. The area is only about 50% owner-occupied, but there is virtually no vacancy in the remaining 50%. The rents, even on the present rising rental market, are as low as $10 to $12 a month. The hatched portion is of the same nature, the houses being scattered."
Fresno,D6,NA,D,"This area, which is entirely surrounded by the business district of Fresno, is about 85% occupied by Armenians, most of whom are uneducated. It is claimed that this is the least desirable type of Armenian, the educated group being found in other parts of the city. These people are engaged as laborers, factory workers, and small tradesmen, with incomes ranging from $600 to $1,800 a year. The remaining 15% of the population in this are American white laborers and factory workers, the houses in this area have an original cost from $2,500 to $7,000, but the average age is as high as 30 years. Most of the houses are of frame construction with a scattering of old brick houses. There are no deed restrictions here, and the whole area is zoned for business. The area is perhaps 75% owner-occupied and shows no vacancy at the present time. Rentals average $20 to $25 a month and have shown little appreciation since the low point of the depression, at which time they averaged perhaps closers to $20 a month. Mixed in with the residential property in this area are small shops and grocery stores. It is definitely a hazardous area for mortgage lending."
Fresno,D7,NA,D,"This small area, while still zoned residential, is hemmed in on three sides by railroad yards, with their attendant industries. While there are a few Armenians in this district, most of the residents are American white laborers and wage earners with small incomes. The houses, which range in cost from $1,500 to $2,500, average in age about 30 years. For the most part, they are of cheap frame construction. A few of the houses on the eastern side of the area are of somewhat better quality and reflect a pride of ownership not generally found in the area. The majority of the properties are tenant-occupied, and there is no vacancy at the present."
Fresno,D8,NA,D,"In this area the houses range in cost from about $500 to $2,500. The building in the area is scattered and on the whole shows little pride of ownership, the houses, on one extreme, being simply shacks and, on the other extreme, some rather neat, small houses, the average age is 10 years, the range being from 5 to 15 years. The houses vary in type of construction from simple “board and bat” shacks to fairly well-built frame bungalows. There are no deed restrictions, and there is no zoning. The area is almost entirely owner-occupied. There was practically no sales activity during the depression, and there is neither sales activity nor new building at the present time. The area is bounded on the north by Ventura Boulevard, main artery east to the mountains, upon which are numerous small businesses. The nearest transportation into town form this area is at the northwest corner, where a street car line ends. The area is provided with gas and electricity but no water, lighting nor improved streets."
