Zoning limits improvements to single-family residences and provides for uniform placement of improvements.

Proximity to Westwood and Beverly Hills provides conveniently available schools, churches, trading and amusement centers. This area consists of three subdivisions: Bel-Air, Holmby Hills and Beverly Estates, all of which have been developed within the past 15 years in an orderly manner and under efficient sponsorship. This area represents, without question, the highest type of residential construction and maintenance in Los Angeles County. Homesites range in size to from 2 to 15 acres, which sell for from $7500-12500 per acre. Cost pf three recent improvements, including sites in Holmby Hills, were reported to be $80000, $100000, and $110000. It is noticeable that new construction is along conservative lines but represents the highest type of architectural skill. Extensive improvements of less pretentious character, in a price range of $25000-$35000, have taken place in Stone Canyon and tributary valleys in the past 3 years. Sales demand in the area is good.

The characteristics of this section are very similar those of Palos Verdes Estates; however, deed restrictions have not been modified and minimum improvement requirements are so high that land improved is only about 5%, and it is not believed that a successful development is feasible until some adjustment of restrictions is made.

Development of this area, which began some 20 years ago, has been irregular, then distinct waves of activity having been experienced, the last of these beginning in 1936 under stimulus of FHA financing, has been the most intense and is still under way. This intermittent activity has resulted in a spotted and more or less inharmonious aspect. New construction is of much better quality than the old, being of standard quality or better.

Maintenance indicates pride of occupancy and architectural designs are generally attractive. There are many scatter blocks located near arroyos or below steep hillsides where there are real flood or landslide hazards. However, well-conceived control projects have done much to minimize such dangers and in many cases such hazards are more mental than real. Las Encino’s Canyon properties have suffered most in the past from this menace. The area is an isolated one and, as has been indicated, is inclined to heterogeneity, and this is particularly true of the section west of Canada Blvd. The greatest activity has been in the northern part of the area and it is there that most of the multi-family structures are located.

Most streets are improved but are generally short dead-end thoroughfares emanating from Linda Vista Avenue. This area was originally a chicken ranch district, and its transition to a residential section began about 1925. Street and other improvements were financed through an issue of Ad valorem Tax Bonds, popularly known as Mattoon District Bonds. This indebtedness in conjunction with the depression retarded development, and it was not until the bond issue was refunded and the advent of the FHA that activity was resumed. Population, improvements, maintenance and architectural designs are all of a heterogeneous character. Many of the old 4 and 5 room ranch type bungalows are still in existence and in spite of many new well-constructed dwellings they give the area a spotted appearance. Distance from conveniences, poor transportation facilities and lack of deed restrictions are also unfavorable factors. Favorable influences are: large number of high grade improvements, rapid increase of better quality inhabitants, and indications of continuance of building activity.

Along East Orange Grove Avenue the improvements are more pretentious and really lend a background to the more modest imrpovements on the side and other streets. Construction is of standard to better quality. Maintenance is of good character and indicated high pride of occupancy. Architectural designs, while individually appealing, lack somewhat in uniformity of designs, being a mixture of one and two-story structures, which gives to some parts of the area a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. The “red” area to the east has no influence upon this area as the two are separated by the “Eaton Wash” which is quite wide at this point. This area is by no means fully developed and should not be disassociated from the “green” area which it surrounds, as it is probable that in time parts of this area will be joined with the “green” area. This area is more than “still desirable” but can currently only be assigned a “medial blue” grade.",Pasadena 2nd B-31 4-14-39,

This area together with “Grand Ave. District” constitutes the old aristocratic residential section of Pasadena and has a nationwide reputation. Many of the structures are 50 years old. Approximately 10% of improvements are of the mansion type occupying from one to five acres and costing in some cases up to $1,000,000. A typical structures of this kind is the 30 to 40 room residence of Phil Wrigley, which occupies the whole block on the west side of Orange Grove Ave. between Arbor and Lockhaven Streets. Many nationally known captains of fiancé and industry maintain homes in this area. During the past several years new arterial shave been constructed which greatly accelerate auto travel to Los Angeles. This has attracted Los Angeles business and professional men to this area and many new 6 to 8 room homes have been constructed. The new improvements have been largely built along Bradford and Bellefontaine Sts. In the southern part of area below Columbia St. Lot values in the area run up to $125 per front foot on Orange Grove Ave. and range from $30 to $50 per front foot in the area as a whole. These prices seem out of proportion compared with lot values in other parts of the city. While this area has many of the qualifications of a first grade area and the district will undoubtedly retain its desirability as a single-family residential section for a great many years to come, the average age of improvements and the large number which are “for sale” precludes assignment of better than a “high blue” grade.",Orange Grove Av.

Construction ranges from standard to superstandard quality. Maintenance is of good character and in many cases mitigates age and obsolescence. Architectural designs of improvements are of great variety and this, together with a large variance in age, gives the area a somewhat heterogeneous aspect. Population is fairly homogeneous, although there is a wide differential in incomes. The area contains many large old live oak trees which add to its charm and desirability. Conveniences to Los Angeles is one of the location’s chief attractions.

No construction hazards. It is difficult to estimate the land improved owing to fact that homesites run from 1 to 20 acres. Deed restriction shave expired upon 75% of area and more will expire on January 1, 1940. An effort to renew or extend provisions providing racial protection is meeting with success. This unincorporated territory is under County government whose zoning ordinances are inadequate. Public transportation is inadequate, shopping centers are distant from parts of area. Schools are good and readily available, and church facilities are convenient. Up to 1905 this area was largely citrus groves, and development began by the purchase of these groves by eastern people for winter homes, who replaced the ranch homes with imposing mansions. This, by and large, is the pattern of the area. Many of the old being super standard. Maintenance, likewise, shows high pride of possession. Architectural designs, as well as landscaping, are individualists and add glamour to the district. This area gives evidence of having been the “melting pot” of the upper income brackets of the nation. This is indicated by the wholesale manner in which indigenous plant life of the various sections of our nation have been injected into the decorative features of those various estates. Horticultural and floricultural novelties of all sections of the nation have been introduced into the decorative scheme of the various holdings. The evergreens of the eastern seaboard and Pacific Northwest are particularly in evidence, and on New Year’s Eve, Santa Anita Avenue is a blaze with an electrical display from these evergreens which border that thoroughfare. There is, however indications of a transition in the area. While many original owners are still residents, properties are more and more passing into control of 2nd and 3rd generation owners. This is definitely suggested by the fact that within the past few years several of these old estates, which for various reasons, have become alienated from original owners, have been subdivided; the old mansions demolished and less pretentious structures and grounds have taken their place. This is particularly obvious in the district between Calaveras and Mariposa Sts. and Santa Anita and El Molino Aves. In this district at least one old estate has been subdivided and 20 new 5 to 7 room bungalows of modern design and extra standard construction have been erected on generous sized lots to take the place of the old improvements. Demolition of another original old mansion was observed in another part of the area. What this portended could not be learned, but there is no doubt that this district is in a transition period. If imagination were allowed full sway, based upon recent developments, a 1st grade might logically be assigned, based upon residential desirability over the next 10 or 15 years. However, the area as a whole gives no such optimistic indication and, based upon present definite prospects, it is thought that all that is justified is a grade of “high yellow” with the suggestion that a future survey will break the area down into several grades.

Improvements in the northern part are less attractive than those in the southern section and a few “cabins” will be found along Kirkwood Drive. On the whole, construction and maintenance is of good quality. Population is homogeneous, the area having a distinct appeal for people in search of view lots. The average lot value in the area is probably around $1500. It is possible in time that this area should be broken down and graded separately.

This is a multi-automobile area and is only 5 minutes drive to Hollywood where all conveniences are all readily available. This area was subdivided about 15 years ago and shows its greatest period of development during following 5 years. Since its initial activity growth has largely depended upon the specialized demand of those seeking this particular type of neighborhood. The area is characterized by tis winding paved streets with steep grades and confusing locations. Construction and maintenance, while of excellent quality, is exceedingly expensive owing to excessive costs below the sill lines. Architectural designs are generally pleasing and the area is not without charm. Mortgage institutions limit their financing to high margin loans. Size and topography of individual sites govern lot prices. There is a high percentage of home ownership; however, owing to the very limited market forced sales are likely to be made on a basis far below reproduction costs.

This area was subdivided some 15 years ago and has experienced a more or less spasmodic development, its greatest activity having been since the advent of FHA financing. Construction is of good quality and maintenance shows pride of ownership. Population is homogeneous and generally economically sound. There is a lack of uniformity in architectural designs and promotional effort on the part of sponsors leaves something to be desired. This undoubtedly accounts for a seeming lack of building progress. Although deed restrictions permit multi-family structures in stated locations, there are as yet comparatively few such improvements. There is a wide variance in size and price of homesites, but values have been quite stable for the past 3 years. There are a few Japanese gardeners in the area but they are not considered permanent residents.

This area has been subdivided at various intervals during the past 25 years, and growth has been slow. In the past few years, under stimulus of FHA Title II financing, activity has increased considerably. There are some seven hills within the area and improvements are scattered in groups of 10 or more dwellings throughout. The smaller dwellings are usually in the valleys while the more imposing structures occupy the hillside view locations. While some of the improvements are old they are generally of good quality construction with satisfactory maintenance. Population varies greatly and there is very little cohesion between the various small settlements. The area is adjacent to two street car lines, and bus service is also available. Numerous arterials permit quick (10 minute) auto transportation to Los Angeles Civic Center. Climatic conditions are favorable and topography lends itself to view location homesites.

The western portion from 6th St. and north part from San Marino Ave. were subdivided and is well built up with moderate sized bungalows. The southeast section south of San Marion Ave. and east of 6th St. is the most choice part of area and was put on the market about 10 years ago but developed very slowly until 1937, but has grown rapidly since that time. This is a highly regarded district and, although it is inclined to be heterogeneous both as to population and improvements, it is considered as being still desirable as a place to live. Maintenance, while somewhat spotted, generally indicates pride of occupancy. Owing to its favorable location this is a good rental area. As a consequence a number of small multi-family structures have been built in the western section of area.

The construction of older dwellings is of substandard to “shack” construction. New improvements on the contrary are of good quality and pleasing architectural designs, most of the homes being built with FHA Title II financing. This contradictory condition is responsible for the wide spread shown above. There is also a wide variance in both price range and maintenance. As a natural sequence of the foregoing, population is heterogeneous. Proximity to the S.P. Ry., Grand Central Airport, and industry to the north and west and business to the south are unfavorable factors. Nearness to employment is a favorable influence and current building activity indicates an upward trend. The industrial progress in Burbank and consequent demand for housing is also a constructive influence.

It has considerable elevation and is above fog district, and was first developed some 25 years ago as a resort for those suffering from pulmonary ailments. Recently, under stimulus of FHA financing, many new residences of suburban character have been constructed, but it is still viewed as a “health” section and a number of sanitariums and small cottages for the treatment of tubercular disease are found in the “hatched” portion. Construction ranges from standard to substandard quality and maintenance averages only “fair”. Population and improvements are extremely heterogeneous. This characteristic is even more apparent in the hatched portion of the area where land development averages less than 10% and improvements range from shacks to mansion and estate type structures in the foothills.

Flood hazards were formerly a distinct retardant but, with commencement of a permanent flood control program in 1935, fear of this menace has subsides and remains largely as a mental unfavorable influence. Under the stimulus of FHA financing and its glen-like charm the area has experienced a district upward trend during the past several years. With the background outlined it can be readily seen that improvements, population and maintenance, while greatly improved, are still very heterogeneous in character. Conflicting influences make it extremely difficult to predict the future trend of this area. The heavy rainfall and many floods of last years affected this district adversely. Natural charm and conveniences to Glendale Junior College are favorable influences offsetting to some extent the negative factors indicated.

Part of this district was originally subdivided a number of years ago, but was far from successful.

Constructive ranges from substandard to standard quality. Architectural designs are individually attractive and usually harmonious as a whole. Population is inclined to be heterogeneous, and while owner occupancy is high, equities average so low as to threaten the economic stability of the area. Practically all improvements are being constructed by speculative builders whose profits are said to be largely derived from arbitrary increase in land prices. Sales are being effected by “high pressure” methods and there is evidence of increasing sales resistance, as many completed dwellings remain unsold.

This area is one of the older parts of Hollywood proper and was subdivided some 20 years or more ago. It has since been built up with 5, 6 and 7 room dwellings. Since deed restrictions began to expire the trend has been strongly to multiple family dwellings; in fact, single family dwellings in this area are considered an under-improvement. From Sunset Blvd. south to Fountain Ave. between Wilcox Blvd. and Highland Ave. there is a strong Catholic concentration which favorably influences prices and demand in that neighborhood. Proximity to industry on the south and business on the north while decreasing desirability of single family dwellings, has a stimulating effect on land values. Adjacence to the center of the growing radio broadcasting industry has been a favorable factor, particularly upon rentals.

Construction ranges from good to substandard with some “jerry building”. Maintenance is very spotted, being fair to good west of Las Palmas Ave. and poor to fair in balance of area. This, together with wide range in age of improvements, gives the area a heterogeneous aspect. Population, 15 to 20% of which are Jewish, is inharmonious and indications are that it will become more so. While there are comparatively few multiple family structures, the area being preponderantly single family dwellings, the trend is toward that type of improvement. In fact, with lot values around $40 per front foot, construction of 5 and 6 room cottages is hardly practical, even at prevailing high rentals. This rental situation has been largely the result of increasing employment in the motion picture and broadcasting studios located in close proximity to the area. Regardless of favorable price trends the desirability of the area from the standpoint of single family homes is downward, and, in view of the numerous unfavorable factors, the area is accorded a “low yellow” grade.",Hollywood 3rd - C-85 2/24/39,

Construction is generally of standard quality but there is evidence of some “jerry building” in the older residences. Maintenance is generally good, particularly in the southern portion and section west of Arden Ave., where pride of ownership is quite evident. The presence of a number of 4 family dwellings and some large apartment houses detract from the general appearance of the area. There are some scattered “island” developments where improvements are of higher quality and more desirable; these, however, are too small to segregate. Population of area is mixed and is only homogeneous in sections. The motion picture studios on the northern boundary favorably affect values and rentals. The recent location of a radio center in the vicinity has also been a favorable influence. Adjacence to the “red” area to the north constitutes a trend of an infiltration of subversive racial elements.

The predominant type of improvement is duplexes generally of 7 to 8 room units and quadruplexes of 5-room units. Construction and maintenance are of excellent character and architectural designs are harmonious. Population is of the upper medium income group, approximately 20% of which are Jewish families. The southern half is considered more desirable and commands better rentals than the northern part. This is probably on account of its proximity to the widely known “Miracle Mile” trading area along Wilshire Blvd. Land values are firm and vacant lots have sold as high as $100 per front foot. The apartment houses in the area are largely located in the southwest part. The block east of La Brea Ave. between 2nd and 3rd Sts., which has long been occupied by a horticultural nursery, is now in process of being subdivided.

This area comprises several subdivision which were placed upon the market from 1904 to 1910 and developed into part of Los Angeles’ most exclusive residential district. Owing to its very favorable location, when deed restrictions began to expire some 10 years ago, multi-family structures began to appear. The transition from an exclusive single-family neighborhood to a residential income district is proceeding in such an orderly manner and the new structures are so nearly in keeping with the neighborhood that there has been a minimum disturbance of single-family residential values. These multiple housing structures are said to be the most uniform and well-built in the city. The area is surrounded by major arterials upon which outlying business establishments are located. Third Ave., which traverses the area, while not a business street, is an arterial thoroughfare and a traffic hazard.

There are still some original owners in the area whose maintenance shows high pride of ownership, but they are rapidly dwindling. Mortgage institutions report a high percent of repossession and losses during the depression period. The area was dormant until the advent of FHA Title II financing, since which time there has been a number of new modern 5 and 6 room dwellings built, largely along Manchester Ave. Old construction was largely of high standard quality but maintenance, except in cases of original ownership, has been only fair. Conversion of large old single-family dwellings to multiples is noticeable, and encroachment of bungalow courts and other income structures is noteworthy. Proximity to Inglewood Park Cemetery, Hollywood Race Track and small oil field, all to the east, and business expansion along Market St. to the west, are all detrimental influences.

Twenty-six of the new improvements are located south of Imperial between Cherry and Yukon and were financed under FHA Title I.

Conveniences are all readily available and schools are outstanding. Public improvements are of good character. This is a typical “company” community, largely owned and control by the Standard Oil Co. of California, which is noted for its employee relation policies. The town’s development was coincident with the building of the modern refinery plant about 25 years ago. Originally, dwellings were largely built and owned by the company but, consistent with the policy of encouraging employees to live near its industrial activities, home ownership has gradually increased. The community suffered but little from “depression ills”, nor has it been greatly influenced by past depression building activity, although it is approved territory for FHA financing. The business district, which contains many establishments owned by nationally known concerns, is a model for neatness and upkeep. Improvements are very generally 4 to 6 room dwellings of good standard construction with high quality maintenance. Architectural designs are pleasing and population is homogeneous. Derogatory influences are adjacency to oil wells, refinery and tank farms. The beach is defiled by a large outfall sewer and oil tanker docks and loading facilities.

Some street improvements and sewers are lacking in southern portion. This large far flung district varies in age from 25 years or more between Slauson and Florence Avenues to new development from Imperial Highway to Los Angeles County line. There are many old structures scattered throughout which give the area a spotted and heterogeneous aspect. There are many blocks, however, which are uniform as to southwestern part where pattern has not been definitely established. There were many foreclosures in this area during the depression period and the HOLC Veterans’ Welfare Board and other large mortgage institutions at one time owned a large amount of acquirements. These have now, however, been largely liquidated. The area is predominantly workingman’s district and there are numerous duplexes, four family flats and bungalow courts scattered throughout. There is a threat of subversive racial infiltration (Negroes largely) in the southeast portion of area. An attempt was made to break this area down, but it is in a transition period at present, and it was not feasible. However, it is believed that in the course of time it will be necessary that this be done and will result in a number of areas grading from “low blue” to 4th grade. A large amount of FHA financing has recently taken place in the area and has had the effect of greatly increasing home ownership and strengthening its grade. Much of the southwest portion of the area occupies County territory which further confuses the situation. Construction ranges from low to good standard quality. Maintenance is generally fair.

Zoning is mixed but pattern of area is definitely single family residential. Conveniences are all available but transportation is inadequate. Many streets are unimproved and sewers are lacking in outlying sections. This area embraces portions of both Southgate and Lynwood and was developed between 15 and 20 years ago as a workingman’s district. Growth was retarded by overlapping Ad Valorem tax districts but these were largely adjusted during the early part of 1938, and since that time between 300 and 400 homes have been erected, largely through the aid of FHA financing. Construction of older dwellings is more or less substandard, but new construction is generally standard quality. Maintenance is spotted but usually of fair character. Both population and improvements are heterogeneous. The Capital Company recently started to develop a large subdivision between Atlantic Blvd. and Otis Ave., north of Tweedy and Abbott Road. The few improvements completed indicate that this section may in time qualify for a second grade area.

This low income workingman’s district has been under development for the past 12 or 15 years. Growth has been greatly retarded by overlapping Ad valorem tax districts. Much of the area has now been cleared of these but not all. This favorable development, coupled with several large industries moving into the neighborhood and the stimulus of FHA Title I Class 3 and Title II financing, has had the effect of greatly increasing building activity. Construction varies widely ranging from “Jerry built” substandard largely financed with FHA Title I Class 3 loans to fair standard quality financed with FHA Title II insured mortgages. The better quality construction being largely in the western part. Maintenance shows but little pride of occupancy, and population is inclined to be heterogeneous.

About 10% of the improvements consist of residential income structures located in accord with tract dedication. Architectural designs of these structures harmonize with the single family dwellings are occupied by the same class of people. Threat of flood from adjacent Los Angeles River, odors from Signal Hill and Wilmington oil fields and proximity to lower grade and industrial areas to the west and northwest, are detrimental influences, which lead to the conclusion that the area is declining and is a misplaced development.

There is also a small oil field southeast of the area but this is said not to be a deterring factor. Proximity to Recreation Park is thought to be a detrimental to immediately adjacent property on account of Sunday crowds, but a favorable influence to balance of area. Construction and maintenance are of medium quality. Population and improvements give the impression of being somewhat heterogeneous.

Development of this section as a suburban farming district began many years ago, but its present residential character began less than 20 years ago. Much of the hatched portion is still in small farms and considerable part of the unhatched portion is urural in its makeup. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that population, improvements and maintenance are extremely heterogeneous. Many Japansese gardeners and Mexican farm laborers are found in the outlying districts. Oil well and tank farms occupy adjacent territory to the west.

No construction hazards. Land improved 90%. Zoning is mixed, but area is predominantly single family residential. Conveniences are all readily available. This is one of the oldest sections of Long Beach which long ago lost its appeal as a residential district. It has for a number of years been slowly developing into an income property area. Improvements are generally old and in many cases lot values, which run from $20 to $30 per front foot, are greater than value of improvements; although construction and maintenance are better than is usually found in this type of neighborhood. Age and obsolescence contribute much to the heterogeneous appearance of the district. There are many medium class apartment houses, bungalow courts and other multi-family structures. The area is a popular one, with the married portion of the Naval enlisted personnel and is a good rental section. That part north of Seventh St. is slightly more desirable than the balance of the area. However, the area as a whole is not entitled to better than a ""high red"" grade.",Long Beach 4th D-64 5-4-39,

Sewers and transportation are inadequate west of Arambe Ave. This is an old blighted laborers district with serious subversive racial influences and threats. However, new construction is of a type indicating an upward trend. This contradictory factor is largely explained by present ease of new residential financing. The prospects for this area are not bright and while a ""medial red"" grade is assigned it is beleived that its downward trend will continue.

This is a typical beach resort area, and is extremely heterogeneous both as to population and improvements. Construction varies from ""shack"" to standard quality, with little or no attention to architectural design. Maintenance is generally of a low order. The section in the southeast part of Redondo Beach north of Juanita Ave. and the section in Hermosa Beach east of Camino Real, north of Pier Ave. are of better quality than balance of area, but proximity to oil wells precludes a higher grade.

Since that time the whole district has been literally engulfed by oil wells. Older construction ranges from standard to substandard. Recent demand for housing has been so great that considerable low grade construction, financed under FHA Title I, has taken place.
