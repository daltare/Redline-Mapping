No flood or other hazards. Very little fog."

Within 10 or 15 years after commencement of the district, the hill section was one of the high-class districts in the city. Due to lack of restrictions and ordinances, cheaper improvements and infiltration of apartments, rooming houses, etc. lowered the class of the property. Some of the best apartment houses in the city in the area but there are many of the medium or lower grade. The district definitely decling from a residential standpoint. "
San Diego,C10,Coronado,C,"This area lies along the Bay and is a desirable district. However in this area is located the servants quarters or the colored population of Coronado. There is considerable building going on at this time and were it not for the colored population and a dump at the northeast portion of the area, same would be classified as a blue area and comparable to B-13. It is absolutely desirable with exception of the facts as set out above and it is necessary fro this exclusive city to have such an area. In all other respects it compares favorably with B-13."

It is ideally located as to all conveniences including theatres, stores, transportation, etc. "
San Diego,C15,East San Diego,C,"Topography level with a few shallow canyons. This area is only slightly lower than B-16 and in practically all respects similar to it. The homes are not quite so well integrated. Some of the residents are somewhat lower in social strata than in B-16. Homes not quite so well maintained and area not quite so desirable. However, area is favorably regarded and its classification in relation to B-16 would probably rate as high yellow, as against a low blue for B-16."

San Diego,C19,East San Diego,C,"This area compares in almost every respect with C-16 except in topography, which is level and deep canyons. Homes generally not quite so desirable as in C-16 and for that reason it would probably take a slightly lower classification than C-16. "
San Diego,C20,NA,C,"This is a small subdivision. Topography slightly rolling. Streets not paved. Owing to heavy Mattoon assessments the area is very sparsely settled and probably should not have been graded at all, however, it is a slightly little area and would probably develop along favorable lines if heavy Mattoon assessments were not against the property.

San Diego,C21,El Cajon Blvd,C,"This area lies along El Cajon Blvd. East of A-14 or the State College area. Sparsely built up with more or less attractive homes of approximately four to seven rooms, certain portions of the area, especially along El Cajon Blvd. Are quite desirable. The eastern portion is in a Mattoon district, which fact has more or less retarded development. In the eastern portion the topography of the land is level and slightly rolling with a few canyons. Building for the most part is concentrated along El Cajon Avenue with a few small settlements north of El Cajon. Even in face of the Mattoon situation, the area is favorably regarded and has had some recent development. The residents are for the most part all white people, belonging to clerical group, mechanics, semi-professional and small-business men, with an income range from $1500 to $2000. The probably cost range of improvements will run from $1500 to $3500. Bus line runs along El Cajon Blvd. Very small portion of area is restricted as to building and for that reason there is no real uniformity as to architectural design. Certain portions of area are restricted by deed to a single family dwelling, with building restrictions of $3000 minimum. This is a difficult area to classify as it is hard to say just what development will take place and what type of development in the immediate future. Were the Mattoon situation adjusted, the area would in all probability develop quite rapidly. However, El Cajon Blvd. has definitely declined from a residential standpoint as this street is being improved with small businesses. There is no flood or other hazards. Fog condition light for this whole area. "
San Diego,C22,NA,C,"Topography high, hillside, rolling and canyons. This area of the Encanto district is more desirable from a home standpoint than D-10 in that it is higher and generally has more uniform and better type of improvements. Residents are of higher social strata with income range from $1000 to $2000. Typical homes in this area one story frame, 5 to 7 room, with few two-story homes. Before the Mattoon assessment was placed upon this area, it was the choice spot of the whole Encanto district. However, due to cheap price of lots, no real conformity as to design and type of improvements was carried out. Area is also spotted with small chicken ranches and other agricultural pursuits. High and slightly it commands a good marine view. A few of the streets are paved. All under Mattoon assessments. At present no development whatever, nor has there been for some years, due to the Mattoon assessments. "
San Diego,D1,La Jolla,D,"This area is known as the servants' quarters of La Jolla, being populated with the serving class of whites, negroes and Mexicans.

The homes are predominantly one-story frame cottages, ranging in age from 8 to 30 years and the probable cost of construction is from $750 to $2000. Homes show little pride of ownership.

It is the oldest section of the city and many of the houses are more than fifty years old. Residents are of a nondescript type, comprising every element of the lower social strata. There is a certain glamour to this section of account of its age and associations. The widely known Ramona's Marriage Place with its Wishing Well is located in this area and is a great attraction to tourists. The area lies on a flat along the San Diego River which transverses it. A steep bluff bounds it on the east. Many of the houses have but little or no value and but a few residents have incomes of more than $1000. It would be an extremely hazardous area in which to make loans although there is some new construction in the northeast section.

No flood or other hazards. Fog condition average. All streets paved. Southern portion compares in almost every instance with that of the north portion of D-6, with the exception of Mattoon assessments, which do not affect southern portion of this area. Southeastern portion is not as heavily populated as northern portion and some ground not so desirable as majority of the balance of the area."
San Diego,D7,East San Diego,D,"This area known as East San Diego and Lexington Park. Topography level, toward the southern portion many canyons. Poorly integrated district of small homes, 3 to 5 rooms. No conformity as to architectural design. Average of improvements approximately 10 years, with cost-range of construction from $1000 to $2500. Lower salaried white-collar classes, naval personnel, laborers, etc. with income range from $900 to $1500. There is no concentration of any foreign element. However, many Mexicans scattered throughout the area.

Typical construction one story small house, range of construction cost $1000 to $1500. In Mattoon District. No flood or other hazards. Light fog condition. Practically all houses in the area occupied, - 60% home-owners; balance tenants."
San Diego,D10,NA,D,"This area rolling, hilly, many canyons. Sparsely settled. The homes as a rule are small but no conformity whatever to type and show little pride of ownership. This is due to heavy Mattoon Assessment in most of the area, which has retarded the growth and development for several years. Residents lower salaried classes, mostly whites and Mexicans with small earning capacity. The land was originally subdivided and sold off in very cheap lots and much of the area was used for small chicken and rabbit ranches, etc. The approach to the area is also detrimental to its future development as a good district. If the Mattoon situation did not exist in this area, it would be possible to pick out certain small districts that would probably take a higher rating than is herewith shown. However, the general attitude of local lending agencies is that the whole area is hazardous regardless of Mattoon assessments. No flood or other hazards. Fog condition very light, Portions of the area more or less remote from transportation and other conveniences, while other portions are fairly close to transportation, market, etc. The small town of Encanto having a small one-street business area of two or three blocks is also located herein.
