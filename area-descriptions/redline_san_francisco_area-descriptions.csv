San Francisco,A1,NA,A,"This area consists of 35 irregularly-shaped blocks, the greater portion of which is known as Sea Cliff, located at the westerly end of the area. The narrow strip from 27th Avenue east to 16th Avenue is an older district, but it is highly regarded as a residential area even though some of the residences range up to 30 years in age. In Sea Cliff proper the oldest structure is approximately 18 years old, the bulk of the houses having been built ten years ago. Sea Cliff is highly restricted to single-family residences, both by ordinance and deed. The other section is zoned by ordinance only, and a few four-family flats and one or two apartments were built in this district before the zoning ordinance came into effect. This does not have a detrimental influence, however. The appraised values of the residences in Sea Cliff range from $9500 to $50,000, and in the area lying to the east, range from $5,000 to $25,000. The area is inhabited largely by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes ranging from $4,000 to $40,000. The income level of around $5,000 predominates. Infiltration of inharmonious racial elements is very remote, and maintenance is of a high order. There are comparatively to vacancies in this area, which is approximately 90% owner-occupied. Schools of all grades are within easy walking distance, transportation facilities are adequate, and parks and recreational areas are nearby. A few of the homes fronting on the ocean to the north have a privately-owned beach. Bordering on the north and east is the U.S. Military Reservation known as the Presidio, and a U.S. Marine Hospital and a large reservoir lie just outside the area. These are not considered a detrimental influence, but rather a benefit, as they are well-kept and insure seclusion. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $9,000. The same home would have rented for $90 a month in 1929, $60 a month in 1933, and $80 a month now."
San Francisco,A2,NA,A,"This area contains approximately three blocks and is secluded court subdivision, very exclusive, and placed on the market about 28 years ago. It is practically 100% built-up, with most of the buildings having been erected some 20 years ago. All improvements are single-family dwellings of the mansion type, ranging from $15,000 to $50,000 in cost and are 100% owner-occupied. Pride of ownership is exceptionally high, and all properties are excellently maintained, some of them having been extensively remodeled and modernized. The residents are made up of professional and business executives, with incomes in normal times ranging from $8,000 to $50,000. Transportation facilities, schools, churches, and recreational areas are in close proximity. Property is zoned first-residential and also protected by deed restrictions. This is an exclusive and secluded area, and there is no possibility of invasion by undesirable social elements. There are but one or two six-room residences in this area. A standard eight-room residence, of two stories in height, in this area would have sold for $15,000 in 1929, for $10,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $12,500. The same house would have rented for $125 in 1929, $90 in 1933, and $110 now."
San Francisco,A3,NA,A,"This area of some 18 blocks occupies a rolling plateau which rises to a height of more than 300 feet in its southern and eastern parts and slopes gently to the north, furnishing an inspiring view of the ""Golden Gate"" and the mountains beyond. It adjoins and overlooks the pine-clad area of the Presidio (U.S. Military Reservation). It is practically 100% built-up, and most of it is owner-occupied by retired and active professional and business men. The income level, with but few exceptions, ranges from $10,000 per year up. In this area there are a number of mansions of the town house type, owned by some of San Francisco's prominent millionaires. Though the majority of the buildings are quite old, ranging up to 40 years, they have been kept thoroughly modernized, and their structural permanence insures a low rate of depreciation. There has been a little new construction in this area from year to year, and the average age of improvements is estimated to be from 15 to 20 years. There is no evidence of age or declining tendencies. With few exceptions, the value of the improvements run from $15,000 to $100,000, and in a few cases higher. There are one or two apartment houses of the high-class type and a few two-story flats in this area. These buildings were erected after the deed restrictions had expired and before the city zoning ordinance became effective. The district is now protected by single-family residence zoning. The character of the improvements and the topography are a protection to this area, and the intrusion of inharmonious social elements is very remote. A high pride of ownership predominates. There are no detrimental influences affecting this district, and it enjoys the advantage of adequate transportation facilities and conveniences of good schools, churches, recreational facilities, etc. Owing to lack of transition, it is not feasible to show fluctuation in prices in this area. The land has a front foot value running from $200 to $600."
San Francisco,A4,NA,A,"This area consists of that section of the Marina District that is zoned first-residential and restricted to single-family dwellings. There are really two parts to the area, and it is deemed best to describe them separately. The North part is the frontage on Marina Boulevard from Buchanan Street to the Presidio wall at Lyon Street. These lots are generally 30 feet wide and overlook the Bay, with the Marina hills in the background. They face directly on either a park or yacht harbor. Although they occupy ""made land"" which was formerly part of the 1915 Exposition Site, these lots have maintained a value of from $200 to $250 a front foot even through the depression, and the average cost of the homes range from $12,500 to $20,000, with one or two a little more costly. The neighborhood is very popular, and owing to the limited area, it is anticipated that there will always be good demand for this frontage. The western part of the area is situated upon natural ground, and 25 foot lots predominate. The improvements consist of one and two-story, six to nine-room dwellings, with a cost range of from $7,000 to $15,000, and is also considered very desirable residential property. This part of the area borders ""C-7"" which contains a large number of three-story apartments and flats. The break from ""green"" to ""yellow"" is justified by the high character of these multi-unit improvements. This entire area is practically 95% built-up and nearly all owner-occupied by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes ranging from $5,000 to $20,000. Climatic conditions are favorable. Threat of discordant racial infiltration is very remote. Pride of ownership is high, and the demand for property in this section held better than in any other section in San Francisco during the depression. A standard eight-room house in the north part would have sold for $17,500 in 1929, $13,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $17,500. The same home would have rented for $150 a month in 1929, $125 a month in 1933, and $150 now. A standard six-room house in the western part of this area would have sold for $11,000 in 1929, $8500 in 1933, and is now selling for $10,500. The same home would have rented for $100 a month in 1929, $75 a month in 1933 and $100 a month now."
San Francisco,A5,NA,A,"This neighborhood of some 20 blocks constitutes the highest class residential area in San Francisco. The lot sizes range from 30 to 100 feet frontage, and in 1928 some of the choice lots with unobstructed view were valued for as much as $1,000 per front foot. This area is zoned 'first-residential'; however, there are no deed restrictions. This area, starting with an elevation of 350 feet in the southern part, descends to less than 200 feet at its northern boundary. The majority of the sites afford an excellent view of the Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the surrounding hills to the north and east. The east and west streets have favorable grades, but the streets running north and south are more or less precipitous. The area is approximately 85% built-up and practically 100% owner-occupied by professional men and capitalists, having incomes ranging from $10,000 per year up. The majority of the improvements are of the town house and mansion type and are of various types of construction. Buildings in this area range from new to an age of 40 years and have a cost range of from $20,000 to $150,000 or more. Owing to the architectural and structural soundness of its improvements and desirability of location, it is difficult to determine the remaining economic life of this district. None of the older improvements have been allowed to become obsolete, and they have been in many cases entirely remodeled and completely modernized. It is quite possible, owing to its natural advantages and the other factors mentioned, that this district will remain the outstanding residential district of San Francisco for a great many years to come. It is not feasible to estimate the fluctuation in values of a typical house in this district during the past eight years, for two reasons: first, that there is no typical house in this area of the smaller variety and, secondly, in the bottom of the depression there was absolutely no market for property of the predominating type in this area. Considerable activity is shown in this class of property at the present time, and it is safe to say that prices will soon be back to the 1929 level."
San Francisco,A6,NA,A,"This area, containing some 20 blocks, is the city's newest restricted, single-family residential sub-division, the main portion of which was placed on the market in 1931 and two smaller tracts platted in 1936. This area is located in what is known as the ""West of Twin Peaks"" section, the most popular medium-priced, better-class section in San Francisco. This section or district of San Francisco is, generally speaking, the only portion that carries deed restrictions and has the added advantage of being sub-divided into wider lots occupied by detached homes. The improvements in this area consist mainly of one-story, frame, single-family residences of five to eight rooms, all stucco exteriors, detached, and many of them having tiled roofs. The cost range of dwellings is from $7,000 to $12,000. No building in this area is older than five years, and over 50%f were constructed within the past two years. F. H. A. Title II loans have been a large factor in the development of this area, which is inhabited largely by the medium-income ""white collar"" class, professional men, small business owner, and executives, having incomes ranging from $3,000 to $6,000 or more. Property is protected by single-family deed restrictions and ""first-residential"" zoning. There are no racial threats, and maintenance is of a high order. The area is 95% owner-occupied, with no vacancies and is approximately 60% built-up. Building activity in this area is very brisk, and as the owners of the three sub-divisions are builders and developers, it is logical to assume that the entire area will be 95% developed within the next two years. Property has some view, convenience to schools, transportation, and recreational areas. A parked reservoir adds to the charm of the neighborhood. This is considered the ""hot spot"" of new residential construction in the $8,000 to $12,500 class. Presuming its existence, a standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $13,500 in 1929, $8,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $12,500. The same home would have rented for $110 a month in 1929, $75 a month in 1933 and $95 a month now. The prevalence of high percentage to cost mortgage loans in this area constitutes a detrimental influence sufficient to warrant a designation of ""low green""."
San Francisco,A7,NA,A,"This area, consisting of some 22 irregularly-shaped blocks, is the best portion of a tract known as Forest Hill, which was placed on the market in 1911 by a progressive sub-divider who took advantage of the publicity about the anticipated effect the completion of the Twin Peaks Tunnel would have on this undeveloped area. This tunnel, 2 1/4 miles long, was completed in 1916 and supplies direct rail transportation from the area known as ""West of the Twin Peaks"" to the City Center and other points. The construction of this tunnel opened up some three or four thousand acres of dormant land into a better-type of restricted sub-division. The average size of lots in this area is 33 1/3 by 100 feet. The street improvements, though costly due to the topography, were not accepted by the city and are being kept in repair by the Forest Hill Association, a non-profit corporation made up of property owners within the tract, for the purpose of maintaining streets, landscaping, and generally enforcing the restrictions. This association is functioning well, and the tract and streets are well-maintained. There is a special tax levy of 3/10 of a mill per square foot monthly for maintenance. Most of the residences in this tract are of the two-story, six to eight-room type, their prices ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, protected by deed restriction and zoning to single-family residences only. The tract is approximately 60% built-up and largely owner-occupied with less than 3% vacancy. Portion of this sub-division are convenient to shops, schools, and transportation, while other portions are somewhat removed from transportation facilities. The residents in this area are largely made up of the ""white collar"" class in the middle-salaried brackets and professional and business men, having an income range from $2500 to $7500. Infiltration of inharmonious social elements is not anticipated. This tract was slow to develop; therefore, there are homes ranging in age from new to 25 years, with the majority of the buildings erected within the past 10 years. This area adjoins the Laguna Hona Home for the Aged. This does not constitute a detrimental influence, however, as the grounds are highly landscaped and well-maintained. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $6500 in 1933, and $9,000 at the present time. It would have rented for $90 a month in 1929, $60 a month in 1933 and $80 per month now."
San Francisco,A8,NA,A,"This area, consisting of some 26 irregularly-shaped blocks, is 95% developed and consists of what is known as Merrit Terrace, West Portal Park, and Claremont Court. These three tracts were subdivided in 1915; however, there was but little building activity prior to 1920. These three tracts surround the western portal of the Twin Peaks Tunnel. The first three blocks on West Portal Avenue from the entrance of the tunnel are zoned for commercial purposes, two blocks of which have been built up with stores comprising a very high-class community business center, with theatres, excellent food shops, etc. This well-developed little business center has a good influence on residential property values, even on those immediately adjoining the stores. This area is made up largely of one-story, five and six-room, detached homes, having a cost range of from $4,000 to $7,500, with 80 to 90% owner-occupancy and few vacancies. The majority of the buildings in this area were erected between eight and twelve years ago. The residents in this area are made up of small business and professional men, office workers, and junior executives, having an income range from $2200 to $5,000. This area is restricted to single-family dwellings, both by deed and zoning. This section is very popular, partly due to being conveniently located to excellent schools, shops and transportation facilities. Maintenance of property in the area is notably good, and there are no known detrimental influences or threats. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $9500 in 1929, $5500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $8500. The same home would have rented for $95 per month in 1929, $50 per month in 1933, and $75 per month now."
San Francisco,A9,NA,A,"This area, consisting of some 20 irregularly-shaped blocks, is known as Forest Hill Extension and a portion of Laguna Honda Park. In the southern portion of this area there is a precipitous hill which rises some 250 feet from the level of this area and slopes off on all four sides. This area is approximately 70% built-up, with the exception of this hill which is but 25% developed. There are some very fine view lots, and one or two very costly homes have been erected. The residents of this area consists of junior executives, some professional and business men, and some highly-skilled mechanics, having an income range from $2,000 to $6,000. Improvements are made up of from five to eight-rooms, one and two-story, single-family, detached, frame and stucco homes, with a cost range from $4,000 to $10,000. The age of these structures is from new to 20 years old, with a majority of them erected between six to twelve years ago. Homes are conveniently located to schools, transportation and shops, and they are 80% to 90% owner-occupied with few vacancies. Maintenance in the area is of a high character and racial problems very remote. Property in this area is in good demand, and mortgagee officials consider it excellent lending territory. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7500. The same home would have rented for $80 a month in 1929, 445 a month in 1933, and $70 a month now. "
San Francisco,A10,NA,A,"This area of 25 irregularly-shaped blocks is approximately 85% developed. It is known as St. Francis Wood and ranks as one of the best laid out and restricted residential sub-divisions in San Francisco. The restrictions are first-residential, permitting single-family residences only, and their architecture is controlled by a board, resulting in uniformity and harmony in improvements. The tract is well-landscaped and is considered the most popular sub-division in its class. It has an undulating topography with rolling elevations from the east to the west, and the streets are contoured for easy grades and maximum construction for view. The improvements in this area have a cost range from $6,000 to $30,000, with the $10,000 house predominating. The range in age is from new to 20 years, the $10,000 house predominating. The range in age is from new to 20 years, the majority of the homes having been erected within the past 12 years. Good grade schools, transportation, parks, shopping, and recreational areas are conveniently located. There are no deterring influences, and there exists a very high percentage of home ownership, with practically no vacancies. There is an upkeep tax approximately $2,50 per lot monthly, which is judiciously expended in keeping up parks, tennis courts, etc. which belong to the tract. This expenditure has resulted in a neighborhood of great charm and attractiveness, which adds materially to property values in the area. The lots in this sub-division maintained their values even during the depression period. Lots are selling for as high as $5,000, which is approximately the peak. The residents of this tract are made up of professional people, business executives, and a few retired capitalists, having an income range from $5,000 to $40,000. The marketability for property in this area is the highest in the entire district. This is partly due to the high standard of maintenance and proper restrictions that exist. There are a number of homes being built in this area, and construction loans area eagerly sought by all mortgagee institutions. A standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $15,000 in 1929, $10,500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $13,500. The same homes would have rented for $125 a month in 1929, $90 a month in 1933, and $105 a month now."
San Francisco,A11,NA,A,"This area, with the exception of the two blocks in the northeast, is known as Sherwood Forest, a sub-division placed on the market in 1929 as a high-class residential park with a minimum building restriction of $10,000. The average size of the building sites is from 75 to 100 feet frontage. Up to 1935 only two residences were constructed in this tract, and during the past year four additional homes were erected at a cost of from $15,000 to $25,000. This area is creating considerable interest at the present time, and as the restrictions are rigidly maintained, it is believed that development will continue at a moderate rate. The property is located on the western and northern slope of Mt. Davidson, which is the highest point in San Francisco, having an elevation of 985 feet. The character of the sub-division is hilly with one or two ravines. A portion of the tract is unplanted and adjoins a 20 acre city park which includes the peak of Mt. Davidson. Residents of this tract are professional men and business executives having incomes in excess of $10,000 per year. The sub-division is somewhat remote from transportation, schools, and stores; however, with its type of inhabitants, this is not considered a serious handicap due to the fact that there are two or more automobiles in each family, with domestic help. This property, adjoining a city park, nestles on the wooded slopes of Mt. Davidson, and having an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean for a distance of 50 miles, forms a picturesque setting for high-class development. A deterring incidence affecting this area is the season of intermittent fogs and winds which is recurrent for three or four months of the year in this section. When this sub-division was placed on the market, the sites were priced from $4,000 to $15,000, according to their size and location. However, no sales were made at these values, and the maximum price obtained to date is $45 per front foot. It is believed that, with the return of normal conditions and a better planned and more aggressive-selling campaign, it will be possible to obtain as much as $7500 for some of the choice sites. Taxes are assessed on a basis of $60 per front foot on the platted portion of the area and at $300 per acre on the unplanted part. The area is 100% owner-occupied, and there are no detrimental influences other than those indicated. The two blocks lying to the northeast are in the sub-division known as Miraloma Park, which is 85% built-up of homes ranging from $4,000 to $6,000. As these two blocs adjoin Sherwood Forest, they maintain a fairly high standard of occupancy of professional men and junior executives."
San Francisco,A12,NA,A,"This area, consisting of some 20 blocks of various sizes and shapes, is 95% developed, the greater portion is situated in what is known as Balboa Terrace, Tract 1 and 2, with a small portion of the best part of MT. Davidson Manor being included in the eastern part of the area. The first construction in Balboa Terrace began in 1921, and a consistent construction program continued until 1929. This tract is located on a general slope to the west and south and is admirably suited to residential construction. It is particularly appealing to people with families, as it adjoins one of the best elementary and junior high schools in San Francisco, is adjacent to two direct car lines, and has adequate shopping and recreational facilities close at hand. This is one of the few subdivisions in the city that has rear alleys for automobile driveways, eliminating the garage entrance from the street which is very common in San Francisco. The type of homes is mostly one-story, stucco, detached with five to eight rooms, having a cost range of from $5,000 to $12,500. The property is protected by deed restrictions, and zoning is first-residential. There is an upkeep tax of approximately $1.00 per month, and the parking is well-maintained. The district is 95% owner-occupied by people of the high salaried ""white-collar"" class, business executives, and professional men. Property in this area is in popular demand, and its marketability has been above average throughout the depression. That portion of Mt. Davidson Manor which is included in this area is slightly below the standard of the homes in Balboa Terrace; however, the general character is the same. A standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $12,000 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $10,500. The same home would have rented for $100 a month in 1929, $65 a month in 1933 and $90 a month now. This area occupies an attractive setting, is harmonious in both development and population. A possible deterring influence which was considered when according the area an ""A"" rating was its high percentage of development. An off-setting factor was that property in the area is in good demand, selling readily at fair prices, and that mortgage institutions generally are willing to accord their best terms on residential loans in the area."
San Francisco,A13,NA,A,"This area of some 25 irregularly-shaped blocks comprises the subdivision which is known as Monterey Heights and the western portion of Westwood Highlands. This area is located on a rolling knoll and slopes in all four directions, affording an excellent view from many of the sites. The subdivision was placed on the market in 1925 and is about 65% developed. it is an extremely popular section at the present time, and some 50 new homes were erected within its confines during the past year. There are a few steep slopes, but usually the building sites are fairly level, and practically all afford a view. The platting of the area was an admirable piece of engineering. The homes have a cost range of from $6,000 to $25,000 in Monterey Heights and from $5,000 to $12,500 in Westwood Highlands. There area a few more costly houses on some imposing knolls; however, the $8,000 house predominates. The majority of the houses have canvas walls, tile baths, with the latest modern features, most of them of the two-story variety with from six to nine rooms. The area is properly restricted by deed and zoning, and it is 90% owner-occupied, largely by professional people and business executives having incomes of from $4,000 to $10,000. This area is served by bus transportation, and is only fairly convenient to good schools and shopping districts. Marketability was slow just prior to and during the depression. However, it is increasing rapidly and becoming a popular district. With the normal growth that is now existing, it is estimated that this area will be 90% developed within the next two years. The only detrimental influence, other than those indicated, is the seasonal fogs and wind from the ocean, which applies to the entire area comprising the western part of San Francisco. Many F. H. A Title II loans are being made in this area, and competition among mortgagee institutions for them is very keen. This factor is believed to be a potent one in stimulating development in the area. In addition to this, the area has an attractive setting, is being harmoniously developed, and is in the path of normal growth. A standard six-room house, with two baths, in this area would have sold for $12,500 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $11,000. The same home would have rented for $100 a month in 1929, $65 a month in 1933, and $85 a month now. "
San Francisco,B1,NA,B,"This area of 85 blocks was originally sand dunes and retains this same rolling topography. It constitutes the western portion of the ""Richmond District"", and is zoned second-residential, with the exception of one block and five half-blocks, zoned first residential, and 37 quarter-blocks on Balboa and Cabrillo Streets zoned for business. A well developed shopping center occupies this zoning. There are no deed restrictions. The area is popular with the medium income group of professional and business me, ""white collar"" workers, and higher-class skilled mechanics and artisans. Annual incomes range from $1800 to $5,000. There is no threat of undesirable racial influences. The eastern part of the area is 90% built-up, tapering off to 50% in the extreme western portion, being 75% to 80% developed as a whole. Improvements consist of stucco, frame and stucco, row and detached houses and bungalows, costing from $4,000 to $7,000, with a number of two-family flats and small corner apartment houses in the $7,000 to $12,000 cost range. While somewhat heterogeneously developed in spots, maintenance is generally good, indicating a pride of ownership. A few buildings were erected some 30 years ago, but a majority of the property has been improved since 1920. On the northwest boundary of the area, below a bluff, lies the far-framed ""cliff House"" and ""Seal Rocks""; on the south it joins Golden Gate Park, while to the north is the Lincoln Park Municipal Gold Links. These all add to the attractiveness of the district. Good schools, and churches are conveniently located, and the area, which is densely populated, is served by four car lines to the City Center, which is four or 4 1/2 miles distant. This distance from the down-town district and the time consumed in getting there, is a deterring influence, as is the fog and wind condition which prevails at certain seasons of the year. Although rising land values tend to increase the burden of ownership, the tax situation as a whole is equitable. The classification of this area as ""blue"" does not complete the picture. There are spotted blocks here and there which could be designated ""high yellow"", and on the other hand, there area scattered blocks fronting Golden Gate Park which could be classed as ""low green"". There are also 12 blocks in the northwest section of the area adjoining Sutro Heights and the military reservation, which are hilly and afford a pleasing view of the Pacific Oceas and Golden Gate Park, that are less than 50% improved and give evidence of developing into a higher grade, possibly a ""high blue"" or ""low green"". At present the same general characteristics justify the inclusion of this district in one area, but within ten years it will have to be broken up into a number of separate units. Already parts have reached a peak and are in that static stage which precedes a decline. Marteksbility in the area is generally good, with values tending upward. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8,000 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6750. The same house would have rented for $75 in 1929, $47.50 in 1933, and $65 now."
San Francisco,B2,NA,B,"This small area of six blocks has the same rolling topography as ""B-1"". Half of the area is known as Lincoln Manor, a subdivision placed on the market approximately 30 years ago, is improved with two-story, detached homes, and is zoned first-residential. The balance is zoned second-residential and contains some two-story flat buildings of the newer type. Properties have a value of from $5,000 to $10,000 and are largely owner-occupied by professional and business men of the junior executive type, having incomes ranging from $2,000 to $5,000. The area, which is 95% built-up, is well-maintained and has but few, if any, vacancies. Improvements have an average age of from 12 to 15 years. Excellent school facilities are within easy walking distance, and transportation facilities are good. Immediately to the north of this area is a public golf course which adds to the attractiveness of the district. Properties in this area enjoy ready saleability. A rating of ""high blue"" is justified. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $5750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7750. The same home would have rented for $80 a month in 1929, $50 a month in 1933, and $67.50 a month now. "
San Francisco,B3,NA,B,"This area of 10 blocks is 90% built-up with mixed single and multiple family bungalows, houses, and flats, ranging in age from five to 20 years and in value from $3500 to $9,000. It is zoned second-residential, provision being made, however, for a certain amount of business along Clement Street. The residences are some 70% owner-occupied, and the population consists of skilled artisans and mechanics and the ""white collar"" workers, having an income of from $1800 to $3,000 a year. There is not to exceed three percent vacancy in the area. There is no threat of racial concentration. Maintenance is spotted but is generally good throughout the district. Just outside the area is Lincoln Park the city maintains one of its car barns. This does not add to the attractiveness of the district. This, together with the seasonal fog and wind condition, probably makes for the low degree of saleability which obtains in this area. The area is a ""low blue"" with an upward tendency. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7,000 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6,000. The same home would have rented for $67,50 in 1929, $45,50 in 1933, and $60 now."
San Francisco,B4,NA,B,"This area of 18 blocks is zoned second-residential and is 97% built-up with mixed single and multiple-family houses, bungalows and flats -- a few corners being occupied by apartment houses -- ranging in age from new to 30 years and costing from $3500 to $10,000. This area is 85% owner-occupied with professional and business men and ""white collar"" workers, having incomes of from $2,000 to $6,000. There are few, if any, existing vacancies. That part of the area which borders on Lake Street is of distinctly higher grade than the rest of the area, the houses being of a higher type and showing a high character of maintenance, although the area as whole is well-maintained. The area is conveniently located for school facilities, transportation is good, and recreational areas are nearby. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, and $5500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $47.50 in 1933, and $62.50 now. "
San Francisco,B5,NA,B,"This area of 60 blocks is zoned second-residential with the exception of quarter-blocks facing Geary and Balboa, which area zoned for business. The district is 90% built-up and from 80% to 85% owner-occupied, with not to exceed 2% vacancies. The terrain is undulating and is well adapted to residential construction. It is largely occupied by business men of the junior executive type, highly-skilled laborers, and ""white collar"" workers, having an income range of from $2,000 to $5,000. There are no adverse racial concentrations in the area. The dwellings are largely of frame and stucco construction, consisting of single and multiple-family dwellings, flats, and some small apartment houses. The single-family dwellings have a cost range of from $4500 to $7,000, with some multiple-family dwellings running up as high as $12,000. The district is from 18 to 20 years old and is still developing. The average age of dwellings in this area probably would not exceed 10 or 12 years, it is amply provided with school facilities, has good transportation, and borders Golden Gate Park. Properties are, in general, well-maintained, and while the types of construction are somewhat heterogeneous, there is a good, stable demand for property in this area. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $5500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $47.50 in 1933, and $62.50 now. "
San Francisco,B6,NA,B,"This area consists of some 16 blocks facing on Funston Boulevard, a part-thoroughfare which runs from the Presidio to Golden Gate Park. It is level and is 95% developed with frame, stucco, and brick single-family residences, having a cost range of from $8,000 to $20,000 and ranging in age from 5 to 20 years. The inhabitants consist of professional and business men of the executive type with incomes ranging from $4,000 to $15,000. It is zoned second-residential but is 95% owner-occupied, which protects it from the infiltration of lower-class properties. The type of development is far above that of surrounding areas and justifies the ""high blue"" rating which is given it. The area is near schools of all grades, has good transportation facilities, and its proximity to the Golden Gate Park adds to its desirability. The area is exceedingly stable, and there are very few transfers of property, although there is no sales resistance. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $6500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7500. The same home would have rented for $80 in 1929, $60 in 1933, and $72.50 now."
San Francisco,B7,NA,B,"This area, consisting of nine blocks, is 100% developed, and is zoned second-residential, improvements consisting largely of single-family frame and stucco, row and detached dwellings, with a few four-family flats. The cost range of the dwellings is from $4500 to $8500 and the average age from 10 to 15 years, a few being as much as 30 years old. The topography is very favorable for residential construction. The district is occupied by professional and business men and ""white collar"" workers, having incomes of from $2500 to $5,000. The area is a homogeneous one, and maintenance shows a high degree of pride of ownership. There are no vacancies in the area, and it is very largely owner-occupied. School and transportation facilities are conveniently available, and adjacent parks and recreational centers add to the desirability of the area and are a factor in the steady demand at fair price levels for property located in this district. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8,000 in 1929, $6,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7250. The same home would have rented for $75 in 1929, $55 in 1933, and $67.50 now."
San Francisco,B8,NA,B,"This area, consisting of 11 blocks bordering Golden Gate Park, is 100% built-up, the improvements consisting of single-family detached and row houses of frame, stucco, and brick construction, having a cost range of from $4,000 to $10,000 and being from 8 to 30 years of age. There are also a few flats and apartments in the area which is zoned second-residential. The district is largely occupied by professional and business men with an income range of $2,000 to $6,000. There are no racial concentrations, and the possibility of there being any is remote, as the area is very largely owner-occupied, and a high degree of pride of ownership exists. There are apparently no vacancies here. While Area ""C-2"", which joins it on the north, is undoubtedly a deterring influence, this is more than offset apparently by the beneficial influence of Golden Gate Park and the convenience of its location, being near schools, churches, and transportation facilities. These probably account for the high degree of marketability of property in this area. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $5500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $42.50 in 1933, and $62.50 now."
San Francisco,B9,NA,B,"This narrow area, seven blocks in length, is situated on the southerly slope of ridge or plateau occupied by ""A-3"", which strongly influences the character of its northern part. There are many steep grades and sharp declines on the cross streets. As would naturally be expected in a ""buffer"" area such as this is, the improvements are decidedly mixed, and there is a decided contrast between the types of occupants as well. Incomes range from $2,000 to $8,000 and more, and property values, from $5,000 to $25,000. The improvements run from substantial, single-family, detached residences to much cheaper homes, with some flats and apartment houses where zoning permits. A small portion of this area is zoned first-residential and the remainder second-residential, with fractional blocks along Sacramento Street zoned for business. This district is 100% built up with 90% owner-occupancy and less than 2% vacancy, The area is well regarded, and indications are that its stability will be maintained for many years to come. There is little danger of undesirable racial encroachments. Due to the mixed type of improvements, it is not feasible to give the price range for a standard six-room home."
San Francisco,B10,NA,B,"This area known as Francisco Heights, consisting of some 10 level blocks, is largely composed of what was the old Odd-Fellows' Cemetery and is a redeemed area which was taken over and developed within the past several years. It carries deed restrictions limiting construction to one and two-story, detached dwellings and flats, provision, however, having been made for apartment house constructions certain strategic corners. It is at present 50% built-up and is largely owner-occupied by professional and business men with incomes ranging from $3,000 to $6,000. The improvements consist of frame and stucco bungalows and two-family flats, costing from $7500 to $12,000, all practically new. It is favorably located as to schools transportation facilities, and recreational areas and enjoys a high degree of saleability. A standard six-room house in this area is currently selling for $9500. The same home could be rented for $85. Owing to is recent development, no comparative values can be given."
San Francisco,B11,NA,B,"This area known as University Terrace, consisting of seven blocks, was formerly occupied by a Masonic cemetery which was recently taken over and subdivided. It occupies the southerly slope of what is known as ""Lone Hill"" and has an elevation running from 200 to 300 feet. Lots are usually 25 x 100 feet and are currently selling quite readily at $2250 to $3,000. The restrictions are favorable, although provision has been made for apartment house sites on Turk Street. The area is most favorably situated as regards schools and transportation and recreational facilities. A number of single-family, detached homes area already in the course of construction, and it is judged that the improvement in this district, while similar to that in ""B-10"", will be of slightly higher grade. "
San Francisco,B12,NA,B,"This area is located in what is known as the Marina District and borders areas ""A-4"" and ""C-7"" with both of which it is closely identified. The type of improvements, however, while good and ranging in cost from $8,000 to $16,000, is not so elaborate as that in ""A-4"", and while inhabited by the same type of professional and business men, the income range is less. The area, which is less than 10 years old, is 85% developed and largely owner-occupied. The type of improvement is mixed and consists of stucco bungalows, houses, apartments and multi-family dwellings. Schools, parks, and recreational areas are conveniently available, and transportation facilities are adequate. Many of the higher type of Italians area residents of the area, and property located here is readily saleable. Many of the financial institutions of the city refuse to lend money in this area for the reason that they consider the instability of the filled-in land constitutes a menace. On the other hand, many mortgagee institutions view this area as their most attractive lending territory. The desirability of the whole Marina District is a very much mooted question among the real estate men of the city, and many firmly believe that it has already reached the declining stage. This area has been accorded a ""B"" grading. Ordinarily, it might have been rated ""A', but the presence of a number of small apartment houses, coupled with the fact that there is a question as the physical stability of the land, seemed to justify the lower grading. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $8,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $9,000. The same home would have rented for $95 in 1929, $75 in 1933, and $90 now. "
San Francisco,B13,NA,B,"This area is of approximately 25 blocks borders ""A-5"" on three sides and acts as more or less of a buffer to that area. It is largely located on slopes, some of them quite precipitous. It partakes to some extent of the characteristics of ""A-5"" area, being inhabited by professional and business men of the executive type, with incomes ranging from $3500 to $20,000, who occupy residences costing from $8,000 to $50,000. The improvements run from stucco and brick homes to the mansion and town house types constructed of brick, stone, and stucco, ranging in age from new to 40 years. Part of the area is zoned first-residential with some blocks having deed restrictions, and while there are a number of apartment houses in the district, they are of the type which does not greatly detract from the desirability of the district. Maintenance is of a very high order, and the percentage of owner-occupancy is very high, approximately 90%. There is less than 1% vacancy in the area. School and transportation facilities area available in all parts of the area. Parks and recreational areas are near, and some of the residences have view which greatly enhance their value. This is a border area, protecting San Francisco's most exclusive residential district. It is rated a ""high blue"", and its stability will undoubtedly be maintained for a number of years to come. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $12,000 in 1929, $7500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $9,000. The same home would have rented for $100 in 1929, $65 in 1933 and $80 now."
San Francisco,B14,NA,B,"This small section of five or six blocks, with Lafayette Square which lies immediately south of it, is the apex of a hill some 300 feet high, which is occupied by the mansions and townhouses of some of the old aristocracy, with incomes ranging from $10,000 up; none of the buildings are less than 20 years old, with a cost range of from $20,000 up. Deed restrictions which formerly obtained have expired; however, the district is zoned first-residential. It is surrounded on three sides by a high-grade apartment house district and is approximately 100% owner-occupied, and maintenance is everything that would be expected in a neighborhood of this character. School and transportation facilities are conveniently available, and most of the residences have magnificent views of the surrounding country. This might be rated as a declining area, on account of its age and surroundings, were it not for the type of construction and the class of its occupants. All the dwellings in this area are larger than six rooms, and it would be futile to attempt to place valuations. "
San Francisco,B15,NA,B,"This area adjoins Golden Gate Park on the north, has a rolling topography, and is 95% built-up. It is in the Sunset District and is inhabited largely by business men of the junior executive type, ""white-collar"" workers, and skilled mechanics, having an income range of $1800 to $5,000. There are no racial concentrations, and threat of infiltration of this character is remote. A high degree of maintenance is in evidence in the area. The improvements consist of single-family frame and stucco row and detached bungalows and two-story residences. There is a high percentage of owner-occupancy in this area and but little vacancy. The area is zoned second-residential, but there are no apartment houses, and owing to a high degree of development, but little likelihood of there being any. Primary grade schools are convenient, but high school facilities are at some distance. Transportation facilities are good, and its nearness to Gold Gate Park and the beaches is a beneficial influence. The blocks bordering Sunset Boulevard are particularly attractive, and the area as a whole should be graded a ""high blue"". A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6750. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $40 in 1933 and $60 now. "
San Francisco,B16,NA,B,"This large area of some 84 blocks, which is 70% developed, is situated on what was formerly sand dunes and still maintains that rolling topography. It is inhabited largely by ""white collar"" workers, business men of the junior executive type, and skilled artisans, having an income range of $1800 to $3600 a year. There are no racial problems, and the likelihood of there ever being is remote. The improvements uniformly consist of stucco and frame, row, five and six-room houses and bungalows, with full basement for garage space, valued at from $5,000 to $7,000 and ranging in age from new to 10 years old. It is zoned second-residential, but there are no apartment houses and very few flats in the district, nor is it believed that they will ever be numerous on account of the distance from the city center and the amount of the development which has already occurred. There are apparently no vacancies in the area, which is 90% owner-occupied, and maintenance shows a high degree of pride of ownership. There are two grade schools in the area, and high school facilities are convenient. A car line and a bus line traverse the area, and another car line runs the length of its northern border. Nearby parks and recreational areas add to the attractiveness of the area. A majority of houses were erected by speculative builders, and the impression was gained that they were ""built to sell"". However, the architecture is good, and there is apparently little sales resistance. There is said to be an excellent demand for property in this area at current prices. F. H. A. Title II loans are numerous in this area. It should be stated that in all these Sunset and Parkside Districts, at certain seasons of the year there are heavy fogs and high winds, which are a distinctly detrimental factor. "
San Francisco,B17,NA,B,"This area of some 40 blocks is approximately 70% developed and is situated on what was formerly sand dunes. There is a rolling topography which slopes to the west and south, affording a view in many instances of the Pacific Ocean. Though the land was subdivided some 50 or 60 years ago, the street improvements have been completed within the last 15 years, and 95% of the improvements erected in this area are not more than 12 years old. There is a brisk building activity taking place in this area at the present time, and the character of improvements is generally uniform, being of the one-story and basement, stucco, five and six-room bungalow type, with a cost range of from $4,000 to $6,000. Most of the homes were erected by speculative builders; however, the architecture is pleasing, and there is a good degree of marketability. The inhabitants are largely ""white collar"" workers, business men of the junior executive type, and skilled artisans, having an income range of from $1800 to $6,000 per year. The area is zoned second-residential, permitting flats and small apartments; however, the buildings are practically all single-family residences. There are no racial problems, and the likelihood of there ever being is remote. There are very few vacancies in this area, and it is 90% owner-occupied and shows a good degree of pride of ownership. School facilities and transportation are satisfactory. It should be stated that in all the Sunset and Parkside district at certain seasons of the year there are heavy fogs and winds which seemingly are not a great deterrent, as property in these districts sell readily at advancing prices. A great deal of financing in this area is accomplished by use of F. H. A. Title II loans. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7,000 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6,000. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $40 in 1933, and $55 now. "
San Francisco,B18,NA,B,"This area of some 57 blocks is practically the same as ""B-16"" and ""B-17"". It is, however, zoned first-residential and is a slightly older district. The large banks and other mortgagee institutions generally accord top terms to loans in this area, and many F. H. A. Title II loans have been placed. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $5,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $45 in 1933, and $57.50 now."
San Francisco,B19,NA,B,"The 19 irregularly-shaped blocks composing this area are 35% developed and area known as Pinelake Park. The topography is undulating and admirably suited to residential development. It is inhabited by professional people, business men, and skilled artisans, having incomes of $2400 to $5,000. There are no racial concentrations or threats, and maintenance shows a high degree of pride of ownership. Improvements consist largely of single-family, detached, stucco and frame bungalows and houses, having a cost range of $4500 to $10,000 and an average age of 7 or 8 years. The district was platted and put on the market 10 years ago, but its development was arrested by the depression, and it is more or less dormant at the present time. The area is zoned first-residential and is also protected by deed restrictions. There is little or no vacancy in the area, and the percentage of owner-occupancy is high. Schools and transportation are not conveniently available, but parks and recreational areas are nearby. The setting of the area is very charming, and it is believed that when lack of school and transportation facilities are overcome, this area may progress into a ""green"" classification. Currently, the property in the area is dormant and offers a high degree of sales resistance. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $6,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7500. The same home would have rented for $85 in 1929, $45 in 1933, and $67.50 now. "
San Francisco,B20,NA,B,"This area of 18 blocks is practically the same as ""B-16"" and ""B-17"", with possibly a 10% lower owner-occupancy than those areas. F. H. A. loans have aided materially in financing new construction in this area, and mortgagee institutions generally accord maximum terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7,000 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6,000. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $40 in 1933, and $55 now."
San Francisco,B21,NA,B,"This area of 18 blocks has much the same characteristics as ""B-16"" and ""B-20"", which adjoin it on the north and east. It is considerably higher, however, at its eastern boundary and has a favorable westerly slope, which provides a better outlook. It is 90% owner-occupied, and the improvements are apparently of a slightly better grade and higher price level, probably ranging from $5,000 to $7500. On the other hand, transportation and school facilities are not quite so conveniently located in this area, and it is believed that when there is an improvement in these facilities, demand for property in this district will increase. F. H. A. financing is quite prevalent in this area. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8,000 in 1929, $5500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $45 in 1933, and $57.50 now. "
San Francisco,B22,NA,B,"This area of 24 blocks is similar in every respect to ""B-21"". It is, however, probably 5% more developed, which may be accounted for by the fact that it has somewhat better transportation facilities. A great many F. H. A. Title II loans have been made in this area. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8,000 in 1929, $5500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $45 in 1933, and $57.50 now. "
San Francisco,B23,NA,B,"This area of some 30 blocks is known as Golden Gate Heights and occupies the comparatively level terraces on top of a series of hills, having an elevation ranging from 350 to 500 feet. The western side of these hills is very precipitous, and a splendid view of the surrounding country is to be had from all parts of the area. This is a new development recently undertaken by Mr.. Henry Dolger and the Standard Building Company. Up to the present time the development probably does not amount to more than 5 or 6% of the area but has progressed sufficiently to indicate that the area will probably be occupied by professional and business men of the executive type, having incomes of $5,000 or more. Judging from the buildings which have already been erected, the development will consist of single-family residences running to the mansion type constructed of brick, stucco, and stone. The area is zoned first-residential and is also protected by deed restrictions. To date, it is 100% owner-occupied. Schools and transportation, except by private automobile, are not conveniently available, and high winds and fogs also constitute a detrimental influence. It is said that the promotion is not going very well and that the property offers considerable sales resistance. The opinion is expressed in some quarters that this will prove to be an over-development. However, the promoters are highly regarded and have proven successful in their past undertakings. The area is given a provisional rating of ""blue""."
San Francisco,B24,NA,B,"This small area of 10 irregularly-shaped blocks is known as Mt. Davidson Manor and lies on the lower reaches of the mountain of the same name. The topography of the area is hilly but favorable for residential purposes. The area is 90% built-up, and the inhabitants consist of professional men and business men of the junior executive type, with incomes ranging from $2500 to $5,000. The area is zoned first-residential and also has deed restrictions which provide protection from from racial encroachments. The district shows a high degree of maintenance. Improvements consist of single-family, detached, frame and stucco bungalows and two-story dwellings having a value of from $6,000 to $10,000 with an age average of approximately 8 years. There is 2% vacancy and an 85% owner-occupancy. Schools, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas are all conveniently available. The Pacific Hebrew Orphan Asylum adjoins the area on the east but does not constitute a detrimental influence. Property in this area enjoys good marketability at fair prices, and the area is graded a ""high blue"". A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $9500 in 1929, $6500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $8,000.

San Francisco,B25,NA,B,"This area of 32 irregular blocks is known as Ingleside Terrace and is 98% developed. Its topography is of an undulating character, well suited to residential development. Its inhabitants consist largely of professional people, younger business men, and ""white collar"" workers, with incomes ranging from $2500 to $7500. No racial problems exist or are threatened, and maintenance is of a high character. The improvements consist of single-family frame, brick and stucco residences having a cost range of from $4,000 to $12,000 and an average age of from 8 to 25 years. This subdivision is zoned first-residential and is also protected by deed restrictions. It was put on the market about 25 years ago and currently is 80% owner-occupied, with vacancies amounting to 3%. Schools, transportation, parks, and recreational areas are conveniently available. The area adjoins poor neighborhoods on the east and south, and there is a distinct possibility of a lower income occupancy. The area has reached the peak of its development, and the population is now static. This tract has been the least popular of any of the neighboring restricted areas. Saleability of properties in the area is only moderately good, and there are definite indications of a decline within the next several years. On account of the foregoing, this area is graded a ""low blue"". A standard size-room house in this area would have sold for $9,000 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6750.

It occupies a sheltered section between Golden Gate Heights and Mt. Sutro. The northwestern portion of Forest Hill and Windsor Terrace are included in this area. Population consists largely of professional and business men of the junior executive type, skilled artisans, and ""white collar"" workers, having incomes ranging from $2,000 to $6,000. There is little likelihood of the area having racial difficulties. Maintenance indicates great pride of ownership. Improvements consist largely of single-family frame and stucco, row and detached bungalows and two-story residences, having a value ranging from $4,000 to $10,000 and an average age of eight to ten years. Property in this area was put on the market some 25 years ago, and it has been slowly developing since that time. Some large blocks in the southern portion and two in the northern portion are zoned first-residential, the balance of the area being zoned second-residential. There are, however, no apartment houses or flats in the area, and it does not seem probable that there will be an invasion of this class of construction. There is little or no vacancy in the area, and 80 to 90% of the property is owner-occupied. The southeastern part of the area, which is a part of ""Forest hill"", would have been included in ""A-7"" had it not been for its inaccessibility. The balance of the area is not so isolated, and schools of all grades are within walking distance; a car line and bus line traverse this part of the area, and other amenities are conveniently near. There is a fairly stable demand for property in this neighborhood. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $42.50 in 1933, and $60 now. "

Davidson on a bench or terrace, as there are but few steep slopes in the area. The developed section of Miraloma Terrace and a portion of Laguna Honda Park are included in this area. The population consists largely of ""white collar"" employees, small business men, skilled artisans, and a few professional people, having an income range of from $2,000 to $4500. There are no racial concentrations in the area and but little likelihood of there ever being. The area as a whole is well-maintained and a definite pride of ownership is discernible. Improvements of the area consist of single-family, detached, stucco, and frame houses and bungalows, costing from $4,000 to $6500, having an average age of not to exceed seven years. Part of this area was originally platted many years ago without regard to the terrain. About 12 years ago it was re-platted and placed on the market, and development continued somewhat throughout the depression. It is zoned first-residential, is 80% owner-occupied, with about 1% vacancies. There is a small neighborhood business district in the north-central portion of the area. Schools of all grades are available but are not conveniently so. There is a bus line running through the western portion, from which it is necessary to transfer to get to the down-town areas, and a splendid arterial highway runs through its northern section. A proposed city park, if created, would adjoin the area on the east. Aside from being somewhat isolated, there are no detrimental influences, and the area constitutes a harmonious development, which it is believed will prove a stable one. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $42.50 in 1933, and $62.50 now. "
San Francisco,B28,NA,B,"This area of some 40 irregular blocks, which are 85% built-up, is composed of what is known as Westwood Park and about 1/3 of Westwood Highlands. The topography is undulating, with lowering elevations from north to south. It is inhabited largely by business men, ""white collar"" workers, city employees, and skilled artisans, with incomes ranging from $2,000 to $4500. Racial problems are exceedingly remote, and the area shows a high degree of maintenance. Improvements consist of single-family, detached bungalows and houses of various types, materials, and architectural designs, having/an average age of from 12 to 15 years with values ranging from $4,000 to $8,000. This subdivision was placed on the market about 25 years ago and is zoned first-residential and is also protected by deed restrictions. It is 85% owner-occupied, and there are less than 1% vacancies. Schools of all grades are within easy walking distance, and the area has both street car and bus line service. It adjoins a section of Balboa Park, upon which it is proposed to build a large reservoir. However, it is not believed that this will prove a detrimental influence. Property in the area enjoys a fair degree of marketability. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6500. The same home would have rented for $80 in 1929, $45 in 1933, and $60 now."
San Francisco,B29,NA,B,"This area, consisting of some 10 blocks, which are 80% build-up, occupies part of the northeastern slope of Mt. Sutro, some of the grades being quite steep but offering wonderful view locations. The inhabitants are largely professional and business men with incomes ranging from $2,000 to $6,000 or more. There are no racial concentrations, and the possibilities that there will ever be any racial problems are very remote. A high degree of maintenance exists throughout the district, which is 30 to 35 years old, development having been very gradual and improvements having an average age of 12 to 15 years. The area has been harmoniously improved with frame, stucco, and rustic type, detached, single-family, two-story houses and bungalows. It is zoned one-half first-residential and one-half second-residential, the topography also offering a protection. The homes are 85% owner-occupied with but one percent vacancies. Schools of all grades are within walking distance, transportation facilities are available but not convenient, and parks, recreational areas, etc. are nearby. Sutro Forest is adjacent to the area and acts as a protection from fog and winds and adds to the charm of neighborhood. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6,000. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $40 in 1933, and $55 now. "
San Francisco,B30,NA,B,"This area of some 15 blocks, which are 30% built-up, is known as Mediterranean Terrace and occupies part of the northern slope of Twin Peaks. It is, as the name implies, somewhat in the nature of a terrace, and the approaches are rather steep, the streets' conformance to contours, however, greatly lessening the grades. The inhabitants consist largely of professional and business men of the executive type with incomes ranging from $4,000 to $10,000. There are no racial concentrations, and racial problems are considered very remote. Maintenance throughout the district evidences a very high degree of pride of ownership. The improvements have an average age of five years, the district which is eight years old has a number of very attractive homes, harmonious but individual in character--some of them bordering upon the mansion type, and having a cost range of $8,000 to $20,000. The area is zoned second-residential but is protected by its topography, and homes therein are 100% owner-occupied. A grade school is adjacent to the area, but high school facilities are not as convenient, and transportation accommodations, except by privately owned cars, are just fair, the neighborhood being served by bus lines running on Clayton Street. Parks and recreational areas are available, and the far-reaching views offer a very attractive scenic feature. The area is in a more or less sheltered location, which protects from fog and winds but also has the effect of keeping out much needed sunshine, at certain seasons this is quite noticeable and is undoubtedly a deterring influence. The district is not yet fully developed, but in the improved portion street improvements and street lighting are installed. There are some street improvement assessments in the area, and paving contractor was forced to take over some vacant property in the area for part of the cost of the street improvement; however, this property has largely been sold now. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $7,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7500. The same home would have rented for $74 in 1929, $55 in 1933, and $65 now."
San Francisco,B31,NA,B,"This area of 17 blocks known as Mission Terrace and Colonial Park is 85% built-up and is generally of a level topography. The inhabitants consist of business men, ""white collar"" employees, and skilled artisans, having an income range of $1500 to $4,000, and there are no racial problems. Maintenance throughout the district evidences pride of ownership. The part known as Mission Terrace was sub-divided and placed on the market about 35 years ago, and Colonial Park was sub-divided 11 years ago. Improvements consist of well-built houses and bungalows of frame and stucco, largely single-family and detached, with a cost range of $4,000 to $6,000 and an average age of 12 years/ The zoning is first-residential and there are also deed restrictions. Improvements are 85% owner-occupied, with approximately 2% vacancies. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas are all conveniently available, climatic conditions are excellent, and there is little sales resistance to property in this area. The old Southern Pacific Right of Way skirts the area on the northwest and should be taken into consideration in appraisal of abutting property. Many mortgage institutions will make loans in this area upon maximum terms, but some of the more conservative officials are inclined to modify their terms somewhat. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5250. The same home would have rented for $60 in 1929, $40 in 1933 and $50 now."
San Francisco,B32,NA,B,"This small area known as Geneva Terrace, consisting of six blocks, is 80% built-up and is similar to area ""B-31"" except that it is a newer subdivision, having been placed on the market eight years ago with improvements averaging five years. This area is not bordered by the Southern Pacific Railway as in area ""B-31"". There is quite a little building activity in this area and a number of F. H. A. Title II loans have been made upon maximum terms; otherwise, many mortgagee officials are inclined to modify the terms upon which they will lend. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6750 in 1929, $4,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5250.

San Francisco,B33,NA,B,"This area of 25 blocks, which are 95% built-up, is part of the Crocker Amazon Tract and occupies a relatively level piece of ground sloping gently to the east. The inhabitants are largely small business men, ""white collar"" employees, and skilled artisans, having an income range of $1800 to $3600. There are no racial concentrations, and the possibilities of racial problems in the future seem very remote. The improvements are well-maintained and consist of frame and stucco, row and detached, single-family dwellings, with a cost range of $3500 to $6,000 and an average of 12 years. With the exception of a small neighborhood business center, the area is zoned first-residential, and is partly protected with deed restrictions. The homes are 85% owner-occupied with approximately 2% vacancies. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks, etc. are conveniently available, the climatic condition is excellent, and the small business section in the northern part of the district is considered a beneficial influence. Many mortgagee institutions will make maximum term loans in this area and F. H. A Title II loans are freely granted. Some of the more conservative institutions, however, are inclined to curtail their terms. A six room home in this area, costing $7,000 in 1929, sold for $4500 in 1933 and is now valued at $5750. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $40 in 1933, and $52.50 now. A vacant lot sold for $1500 in 1929, for $600 in 1933 and is now valued at $1100."
San Francisco,B34,NA,B,"This area of some 20 irregularly-shaped blocks, which are 90% built-up, occupies the best part of what is known as Buena Vista Heights and was at one time one of the outstanding residential areas of the city. It is situated upon the sides of an elevation some 500 feet in height, the apex of which lies in Buena Vista Park. There are a number of steep slopes and bluffs, which makes practically every home a view property. The platting follows contour lines and minimizes grades. The inhabitants consist largely of business men, professional people, and the higher-paid ""white collar employees, whose incomes range from $2,000 to $10,000, and there are no racial problems and little likelihood of any. Maintenance, for the most part is of good character and shows pride of ownership. The district is 30 years old and was one of the ""hot spots"" at one time. It is improved with single-family, row and detached residences of frame, brick, and stucco, with a cost range of $4,000 to $15,000 and an average age of 15 to 20 years. The area is zoned second-residential but is protected by its topography and partially by deed restrictions. Homes are 90% owner-occupied with not to exceed 2% vacancies. There are some apartment houses in the lower part of the area where is not protected by deed restrictions. The development is not wholly harmonious. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas are conveniently available, and the fact that the district is somewhat subject to wind and fog conditions is offset by the outlook and convenience to down-town centers which account for the steady demand at fair prices for property in this area. Owing to the age of the district, many mortgagee institutions are inclined to limit the amortization period on loans made in the area; however, it is understood F. H. A. Title II loans have been made for the full 80% of appraised value and twenty year maturity. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8,000 in 1929, $4750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6750. The same home would have rented for $75 in 1929, $45 in 1933 and $60 now."
San Francisco,B35,NA,B,"This area of approximately 15 blocks known as St. Mary's Park, is 75% developed and is of a generally level topography with some steep slopes on the southern border. The inhabitants consist of business men of the junior executive type, skilled artisans and the better-paid ""white collar"" employees, having an income range of $1800 to $4,000. There are no racial concentrations nor threats of future racial problems. The area constitutes a ten-year-old, well-restricted subdivision, surrounded by older areas of heterogeneous character, and is improved by single-family, detached, frame and stucco houses and bungalows, having a cost range of $4,000 to $6,000 and an average age of 7 or 8 years. It is zoned second-residential but is protected by deed restrictions, and the homes are 85% owner-occupied with 2% vacancies. A shopping district adjoins the area on Mission Street, and below the slope on the south it is adjoined by an industrial area. Schools of all grades are conveniently located, and St. Mary's Parochial School is situated immediately to the east of the area. Transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas are also convenient to this district, and climatic conditions are good.Some mortgagee institutions will not make loans in this area on account of its location and a majority of the officials are inclined to modify their terms; however, F. H. A. will insure loans on maximum terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8,000 in 1929, $5,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6250. The same home would have rented for $72.50 in 1929, $47.50 in 1933, and $60 now."
San Francisco,C1,NA,C,"This area, consisting of 24 blocks, is over 95% developed with a heterogeneous mixture of single and multiple family dwellings, flats and apartment houses, having a cost range of $3500 to $10,000 and an average age of from 10 to 20 years, many of the buildings being fully 25 years old. The population of the area is largely made up of ""white collar"" workers, service group employees, and small business men, having incomes ranging from $2,000 to $5,000. There is no racial concentration in the area, and it is at least 80% owner-occupied, with not to exceed 4% vacancy. The area is zoned second-residential with the exception of the quarter blocks facing Geary Boulevard and Clement Street which are zoned for business. Public schools of all grades are located in or near the district, and transportation facilities are good. Its proximity to Golden Gate Park and other recreational areas is also beneficial influence. In spite of the heterogeneous nature of the improvements, the district as a whole shows a fair degree of pride of ownership, and the topography is favorable to residential uses. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6,000. The same home would have rented for $70 in 1929, $45 in 1933, and $60 now."
San Francisco,C2,NA,C,"This area of approximately 66 blocks is from 25 to 35 years old, having been developed following the fire and earthquake in 1906. The area is largely zoned second-residential. Parts facing on Clement Street and Geary Boulevard are zoned for business, and this is also true of scattered blocks on both Balboa and California Streets. The area is largely occupied by small business men, ""white collar"" workers, and skilled mechanics, having an income range of $1500 to $4,000. There are no racial concentrations in the area, although there is a possibility of such infiltration in the future. Construction is of a very heterogeneous nature, consisting of single-family, detached and row frame and stucco dwellings, flats and apartment houses. The single-family dwellings, many of which are old, have a cost range of from $3500 to $8,000. Owner-occupancy is 75%, and vacancies in the area do not exceed 4%. Schools and transportation facilities are conveniently available, and the area's proximity to Gold Gate Park and to the recreational areas adds to its desirability. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7,000 in 1929, $4,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5500. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $40 in 1933, and $50 now."
San Francisco,C3,NA,C,"This area consists of six level, over-sized blocks and is 100% developed. It is occupied by active and retired professional and business men and ""white collar"" workers with an income range of from $2,000 to $10,000. The district is 30 years old, and slowly declining. The improvements have an average age of from 15 to 20 years and a cost range of from $5,000 to $15,000, being largely well-built, two-story frame and stucco structures, which are fairly well-maintained and show a high degree of pride of ownership for an old area. Two-thirds of the area is zoned first-residential, with a number of apartment houses in the unprotected part. It is 80% owner-occupied, with not to exceed 2% vacancies. It is exceptionally well-located with relation to schools, parks, recreational areas, etc. and has the benefit of splendid transportation facilities. The relative tax assessment level is high, which increases the burden of ownership. Age and surrounding affect adversely the marketability of properties in this area. However, it should be viewed as a ""high yellow"". A standard six-room house in this area would have been sold for $9,000 in 1929, $5,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7,000. The same home would have rented for $85 in 1929, $50 in 1933, and $65 now."
San Francisco,C4,NA,C,"This area consisting of some 15 blocks joins what is known as Laurel Hill Cemetery on three sides. It is a rolling area having an elevation of some 200 to 250 feet. A City ordinance was recently passed providing for the vacation of the old cemetery and the conversion of it into either a real estate subdivision or a City park. In either case it will eliminate the proximity to a cemetery which is undoubtedly a detrimental influence, and it will also have the effect of elevating the standard of the neighborhood. This area is occupied by small business men, ""white-collar"" workers, and a high-class service employees having an income range of from $1500 to $4,000. As at present constituted, the area is zoned second-residential, and the improvements are extremely heterogeneous. Although 65% owner-occupied, there is said to be approximately 5% vacancy in the area. The district is most favorably located with regard to schools, parks, recreational areas, all of which together with transportation facilities, are conveniently available. There are no racial concentrations in the area but there is a distinct threat of infiltration of Negroes and Japs from areas D-1 and D-3. However, this possibility will be minimized when the proposed removal of Laurel Hill Cemetery takes place. Most of the mortgagee institutions do not hesitate to make loans in this area. They do so generally however, upon a very restricted basis. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5500 in 1929, $3500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4500. The same home would have rented for $50 in 1929, $30 in 1933 and $40 now."
San Francisco,C5,NA,C,"This area of 11 blocks bordering the northeast corner of Golden Gate Park has a favorable topography for residential purposes. It is from 30 to 40 years old and is 75% built-up. The single-family dwellings have a value of $3500 to $7500, and an average age in excess of 20 years; these dwellings consist of one and two-story frame structures. The area is zoned second-residential and is built up partly with flats and apartment houses. The development has been an inharmonious one, extending over a number of years. The area is occupied largely by ""white collar"" workers and skilled laborers having incomes running from $1500 to $2400 per year. There are no racial concentrations as yet nor any immediate threat of such. The new development taking place in B-10 and B-11 will have a very favorable influence upon this area. The single-family dwellings are 70% owner-occupied, and vacancies do not exceed 4%. There is a fair degree of maintenance, showing pride of ownership. Schools of all grades are nearby, and transportation facilities are excellent. The flats and apartments in the area are numerous but of a good, substantial character. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6500 in 1929, $3750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5,000. The same home would have rented for $60 in 1929, $35 in 1933, and $45 now."
San Francisco,C6,NA,C,"This area of 28 blocks occupies quite a precipitous slope, there being an approximate drop of 100 feet from north to south. It lies directly south of the best residential area in the city and is adjacent to and overlooks two of the oldest areas in the city (""D-1"" and ""D-3"") which contain the largest concentration of Negro and Japanese population in San Francisco. While there is no racial problem in this area at the present time, there is a distinct threat of infiltration of undesirable alien elements from the two areas mentioned. The area is 90% built-up, its development having started some 50 years ago, residential improvements consisting largely of frame dwellings and four-family flats. It is zoned second-residential, and there is a large number of apartment houses and some stores, many of the apartment houses being of very high quality. The area is populated by business men, and ""white collar"" workers, with a sprinkling of professional men, having an income range of $1800 to $6,000. Some of the single-family residences are well-maintained and still exhibit pride of ownership. This is particularly true of the northwest section of the area. One to four-family dwellings have a 60% owner-occupancy, and there are approximately 5% vacancies. Schools, recreational areas, and transportation are all conveniently available. Lending in this area is based to a large extent upon land values, and mortgagee institutions modify the terms of their loans here. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5,000 in 1929, $2,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3750. The same home would have rented for $50 in 1929, $27.50 in 1933, and $35 now."
San Francisco,C7,NA,C," This area shares many of the topographical characteristics of the areas which border it (""A-4"", ""B-12"", and ""B-13""). It is occupied by professional and business men and ""white collar"" workers, having an income range of from $2,000 to $15,000. There are many beautiful single-family residences, both of the two-story and bungalow type, constructed of frame and stucco. This is particularly true of the northwest part of the area bordering ""A-4"", and if it were not for the predominance of apartments and multi-family dwellings, this section would have been made a part of ""B-12"". The situation described accounts for the break from ""green"" to ""yellow"", which occurs where this area adjoins ""A-4"". A small part of this area is situated on ""made"" ground formerly occupied by the 1915 Exposition. Improvements consist of three-story apartments and flats and two-story and bungalow type, single-family, frame and stucco, row dwellings. Many of the single-family residences have distinction and beauty. The single-family dwellings have a cost range of from $6,000 to $12,000, with a large percentage of owner-occupancy and practically no vacancies. In the southern part of the area the dwellings are older, some of them being 30 years or more. Maintenance, however, is of a high order. There is a modern, high-grade neighborhood business center running for four blocks along Chestnut Street, which adds to the convenience and attractiveness of the area. Schools, recreational areas, and transportation facilities are all available, and property in the district is readily marketable. The average age of improvements in the area is less than 15 years, and it is by no means ""definitely declining"". In fact, it is still developing, being not to exceed 90% built up. One possible derogatory feature lies in the fact that one of the approaches to the Golden Gate Bridge, which will soon be completed, runs through this area. While a ""C"" designation has been given, it should be understood that it is a ""high yellow"". Grading of this area was very difficult, and determination was finally made largely upon the preponderance of income property which it contains. The single block bordering the Presidio is the entrance to that military reservation. While some mortgagee institutions refuse to lend in this territory, they are in the minority, loans being usually eagerly sought for upon maximum terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $10,000 in 1929, $7,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $8750. The same home would have rented for $95 in 1929, $70 in 1933, and $85 now."
San Francisco,C8,NA,C,"These 12 blocks occupy a level space immediately south of Fort Mason. The area is zoned second-residential and largely given over to flats and apartment houses. The single-family residences are of frame and stucco construction, approximately 15 years old, have a cost range of from $6,000 to $15,000, are occupied largely by ""white collar"" workers, professional and business men, with an income range of from $1800 to $6,000, and are 60% owner-occupied, with not to exceed 2% vacancy. The maintenance is good, and schools, parks, and transportation facilities are conveniently available. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $9500 in 1929, $6750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $8,000. The same home would have rented for $90 in 1929, $60 in 1933, and $75 now."
San Francisco,C9,NA,C,"This area of some 50-odd blocks occupies a slope of a hill which has its apex in Lafayette Park. Some of its slopes are quite purposes. The area is 95% built-up and has been developing for the past 40 or 50 years. Improvements consist of old residences, flats and apartment houses, many of which are new and of good quality. The single-family dwellings, which are all old and have a price range largely based on land value, are from $2,000 to $7500 and consist of two-story frame structures which are 70% owner-occupied with less than 4$ vacancies. The area is zoned second-residential and is occupied very largely by ""white collar"" workers. There are no racial concentrations at the present time, but there is a threat of infiltration in the southern part from adjacent areas. The area is spotted, but in its northern part the quality of maintenance is good. ""B-14"", which is completely surrounded by this area, lends it dignity, and Lafayette Park, which also lies within the area, adds to its attractiveness and affords a degree of protection. Schools, churches, and recreational areas are all conveniently available. Residential lending is largely confined to income property loans, and there is little lending on single-family dwellings. However, applications for such loans are treated with respect, and liberal terms accorded owing to the increasing value of land in the area. Due to this element of land value, a discussion of comparative values and rentals is not feasible and would be misleading."
San Francisco,C10,NA,C,"These 25 blocks are located in what is known as the Russian Hill District which takes its name from an eminence which rises irregularly from the shores of the Bay to an elevation of some 300 feet in the southern part of the area, the topography of the area being very much of an up-hill and down-dale character with some exceedingly steep slopes, particularly on the western and eastern borders. It is populated largely with business men and ""white-collar"" workers having income ranging from $2,000 to $10,000. There are no racial concentrations, although many Americans of Italian extraction reside here. The single-family residences which have a cost range of some $5,000 to $15,000 which have an average age of 25 years but are generally well-maintained, the type of construction being frame. The area is largely zoned second-residential with a little first-residential and a few quarter blocks zoned for business. The area is largely given over to flats and apartments. Single-family residences are 50% owner-occupied, and there are not to exceed 3% vacancies. It is surrounded on three sides by industrial and business districts, and a city reservoir is located in the northwest portion. It is served by two cable lines, and school facilities are convenient. Owing to its nearness to down-town districts, land values tend to make the single-family residential ownership burdensome. Residential loans are readily granted in this area but consideration is given the age and improvements and land values. Application for F. H. A. loans are quite readily approved upon liberal terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $6000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $7000. The same home would have rented for $75 in 1929, $55 in 1933, and $65 now."
San Francisco,C11,NA,C,"This area occupies the slopes of Telegraphy Hill, which is 263 feet high and is surmounted by the Colt Memorial Tower which rises an additional 187 feet and constitutes the principal observation point in the city. The area was formerly occupied by fishermen and other members of the lower strata of society. In the last dozen years, however, artists, professional and business men, with incomes ranging from $3,000 to $10,000 have moved into the area and built homes costing from $8,000 to $20,000, and there has been an exodus of the lower class social elements. The area is now built-up with 50% of modern improvements. It is zoned second-residential and contains a number of small apartment houses and flats. The single-family residences are 75% owner-occupied, and there are practically no vacancies. There are no transportation facilities other than those provided by private automobiles, and school facilities are not conveniently located. A magnificent view, however, is obtained, and it has the added advantage of being very close to the down-town districts. The property in the district is in demand at increasing prices. The ""Renaissance of Telegraphy Hill"" emphasizes and illustrates what is taking place in a less pronounced degree in many San Francisco districts in what might be termed ""reviving areas"". This area is in no sense a declining one and has been a particularly hard one to grade owing to the mixed type of occupants and for the further reason that it is in a state of transition. It is given a ""high yellow"" designation with the thought that it may eventually develop into a higher grade. Residential loans in this district are eagerly sought by most of the mortgagee institutions and F. H. A. loans are made upon liberal terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $8500 in 1929, $7000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $8000. The same home would have rented for $90 in 1929, $70 in 1933 and $85 now."
San Francisco,C12,NA,C,"This area of some 35 blocks which joins Calvary Cemetery on two sides is approximately 90% built-up and is occupied largely by small business men, skilled laborers, ""white collar"" and service employee groups, with an incomes range of from $1500 to $3600. The district is 50 years old and is located upon the westerly slope of what is known as ""Lone Hill"". With the exception of a few business locations, it is zoned second-residential, and its improvements consist of a heterogeneous mixture of frame and stucco, detached and row single-family residences of various ages, together with a very large number of flats and apartment houses. The single-family dwellings are approximately 70% owner-occupied, and owing to its proximity to schools, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas, it has a very small percentage of vacancy, probably not to exceed 3%. The northeast portion of the area joins one of the heaviest racial concentrations in the city, and while non-existent in this area at the present time, there is an undoubted threat of infiltration in the future. Negotiations are said to be under way by a responsible group of the purchase of Calvary Cemetery for the purpose of sub-dividing it. Should this become an accomplished fact, it will have a very beneficial effect upon this area. This possibility has some bearing upon the grading of this area which is accorded a rating of ""low yellow"". Loan applications in this area are closely scrutinized and are usually made upon a very conservative basis. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6500 in 1929, $4500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $550. The same home would have rented for $60 in 1929, $40 in 1933, and $50 now."

It is 100% developed and is inhabited by skilled laborers, small business men, higher service group employees, and ""white collar"" workers, having an income range of from $1800 to $4,000. There are no racial concentrations in the district, and the possibility of such condition is considered remote. The area is zoned second-residential, and improvements consist of row and detached residences, flats, and apartments. The area is from 25 to 40 years of age, and the single-family residences, which are largely constructed of frame have a value of from $4,000 to $8,000, range in age from 15 to 40 years, and show a fair degree of maintenance. The area is zoned second-residential and has an owner occupancy of 75% with little or no existing vacancies. It is conveniently located to schools of all grades, has excellent transportation facilities, and is adjacent to two parks. Practically all mortgagee institutions will make loans in this area but usually upon a very restricted basis.

San Francisco,C14,NA,C,"This area of 16 blocks surrounding Alamo Square occupies a little stretch of territory having an elevation of some 200 feet. It is inhabited by business men, ""white collar"" workers, and some professional men, having incomes ranging from $2,000 to $5,000. The area has no racial concentration, and white it is surrounded by lower-grade areas, it is somewhat protected by reason of its greater height and further fact that it is 100% built-up with an older but higher-type of improvements. The area is zoned second-residential and contains some apartments and flats; however, improvements consist mainly of single-family residences of frame construction, ranging in age from 35 to 50 years and having a value of from $4,000 to $10,000. These residences are 80% owner-occupied with only a 2% vacancy. Schools, playgrounds, and parks are conveniently available, and transportation facilities are the best. Maintenance in the area indicates pride of ownership. There is a shopping district extending through the area on Divisadero Street. Land values are governing factor in loans made in this area. However, most institutions give favorable consideration to applications but upon restricted terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7000 in 1929, #4250 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5500.

It is largely inhabited by ""white collar"" workers, and skilled and semi-skilled laborers having an income range of from $1500 to $2500. The area is free from undesirable racial conditions and any threat along this line is considered remote. The development of part of this area has been extremely heterogeneous; this applies particularly to the older dwellings. There is considerably new development taking place at the present time which is of a higher order than existing construction. The district is approximately 50% improved with small homes having a cost range of from $3500 to $5000, the ages of which range from new to 30 years old. Five and six-room frame and stucco row and detached bungalows are the predominant type of new construction. The area is zoned second-residential, and while there are none at present, there is a threat of multi-family dwellings and apartments. There is a 90% owner-occupancy in the area, and there are few, if any vacancies. The primary schools are available, but high school facilities are distant. Transportation facilities are considered only fair. There is an attractive view of the Pacific Ocean, and it adjoins Golden Gate Park on the south. There is said to be a steady demand for residences in this section, and improvement is going on rapidly. There is, however, a grave question as to the quality of the construction, and it is believed that the district is promotional and the houses are being built to sell. F. H. A. loan applications are readily approved and most of the loans are for new construction have been of this type. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6500 in 1929, $4000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5000.

San Francisco,C16,NA,C,"This area of 49 blocks, laying along the south side of Golden Gate Park at the beginning of what is known as the Sunset Section, is admirably suited for residential construction. It rises gradually from an elevation of 225 feet at its western boundary to some 325 feet in its eastern part. Its topography is generally rolling without any steep slopes or bluffs. Its inhabitants consist largely of small business men, skilled artisans, ""white collar"" and service workers, having incomes ranging from $1500 to $3600. There are no racial concentrations in the area, and it is not believed that there is any immediate threat of the infiltration of foreign elements. The development of the area, which began some 30 years ago, has been heterogeneous in the extreme, and while the improvements consist largely of single-family residences of mixed types, having a cost range of from $4,000 to $6,000, there are also numerous apartment houses and flats. The area is zoned second-residential, but as will be seen from the map, there is quite a business district in the area. In many parts obsolescence is very much in evidence, and maintenance in the whole area is below par. It is a definitely declining area, and owner-occupancy is lower here than in most other sections of the city, being not to exceed 35% with about 4% vacancy in the single-family residences. It is ideally located, transportation facilities are good, schools of all grades are in close proximity, and it abuts Golden Gate Park. There are no detrimental influences. The area is practically 95% built-up, and it is believed that it will gradually be given over to moderate-priced apartments and flats. Owing to its decling tendencies, great care is exercised in making loans in the area, and they are usually made upon a quite restricted basis. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $7500 in 1929, $4,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $6250.

San Francisco,C17,NA,C,"This area of some 25 blocks is located in a fan-shaped pocket between Golden Gate Heights and Mt. Sutro. It reaches an elevation of some 500 feet in its southern part and is inclined to be hilly. The topography, however, is generally favorable to residential construction, although there are a few steep slopes and bluffs in the southern part of the area. The northern part, with an elevation of 250 feet, is comparatively smooth. The residents consist largely of business and professional men, junior executives, and better-paid ""white collar"" workers, having an income range of from $1800 to $4,000 a year. There are no racial concentrations, and the danger of infiltration of foreign elements is remote. As a whole, maintenance shows a fair degree of pride of ownership. The district is from 15 to 35 years old and has gradually developed during that period until it is now 85% built-up, the improvements consisting largely of single-family detached and row houses and bungalows of various architectural designs and types of construction. A few blocks are zoned first-residential, but the zoning is mainly second-residential, although there are but few apartment houses in the area and not a great many flats. There is 85% to 90% owner-occupancy and vacancies do not exceed 2%. There is, of course, a threat of more flats and apartments being built in the area, but it is believed that it will continue to be preponderantly a single-family residential area. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, and recreational areas are all conveniently available, and there are no detrimental influences. This area might almost be graded a ""low blue"" were it not for the considerable amount of obsolescence discernible. Loan applications in the area are favorably received by all mortgagee institutions and loans in many cases are made upon maximum terms.

Schools or all grades, transportation facilities, parks, and playgrounds are all conveniently available. Owing to its remoteness, there is a degree of sales resistance to property in this area. New construction in the area which is limited in extent is of a higher order than existing improvements, and this is an indication that in time this area may reach a higher grade. There is a tendency upon the part of mortgagee institutions to stiffen the terms on loans made in the area. However, the F. H. A. loans have been approved for 80% of appraised value and for 20 year periods.

There is quite an extensive business district along Divisadero Street which constitutes the area's eastern boundary. Schools and transportation facilities are conveniently available, and many parks and recreational areas are close by. Property in the area is not readily saleable, and assessed value of lands is so high that is constitutes a distinct burden to the home owners. It is felt that when and if Laurel Hill Cemetery is sub-divided and developed, the western portion of this area may be favorably affected. Only one mortgagee institution was found that would accept applications for loans in this area and it did so largely as a matter of principle, officials stating that loans would only be made upon extremely modified terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5000 in 1929, $2500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3500. The same home would have rented for $45 in 1929, $22.50 in 1933, and $32.50 now."
San Francisco,D2,NA,D,"This area of 36 blocks occupies a level section surrounding the Golden Gate Park ""Panhandle"". It is zoned second-residential and business, and is very largely given over to small apartment houses and flats, many of them with stores occupying the first floor. There are, however, a goodly number of old single-family residences which were at one time occupied by higher income business people and professional men. These are now largely owned and tenanted by small business men, ""white collar"" workers, and skilled artisans having incomes of from $1200 to $3,000. On account of age there is a possible threat of an infiltration of inharmonious racial elements. However, no concentrations exist at the present time. The single-family residences had a cost when new of from $4,000 to $10,000, and consist largely of frame construction. The area is 95% built-up, and the single-family residences are 80% owner-occupied with not to exceed 3% vacancies. Owing to its convenience to schools, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational area, there is a fair demand for property in this area. The area is very spotted and one or two blocks might be classified as ""high yellow"". Land values have a tendency to increase the burden of ownership of single-family residences. This area has distinct possibilities as a medium to a high-grade apartment house district. Mortgagee institutions are inclined to be quite conservative about making loans on one to four-family residential units, and several officials stated that they would not consider loans on single-family residences in the area. When such loans are made they are largely based upon land value. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6,000 in 1929, $3750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4750. The same home would have rented for $60 in 1929, $37.50 in 1933, and $47.50 now."
San Francisco,D3,NA,D,"This large area of 125 blocks or more slopes gradually from northwest to southeast. It is what might be termed the ""melting pot of the West"" and is the nearest approach to a slum district in San Francisco. It has a highly congested population consisting of Japanese, Russians, Mexicans, Negroes, etc. having a very low income level. In the north-central part of the area is the largest concentration of Japanese in the City, and Negroes predominate in its northwest section. The southern part is much less affected by the racial situation which has been described, and has many of the qualities of Area D-4. The area is approximately 100% built-up and has a population density estimated to run up to as high as 100,000 to the square mile. The percentage of owner-occupied is very low, and vacancies are numerous with an average of over 10%. About 50% of the area is zoned second-residential, the balance being given over to the business and light industry. There are very few single-family residences in the area, and they are invariably very old. The area is well provided with schools, transportation facilities, and recreational areas. Only one mortgagee institution was found who would even consider residential loans in this neighborhood, and they will only consider applications on the basis of land value. A standard six-room house in this area would probably have sold for $4250 in 1929, $2740 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3500. The same home would have rented for $40 in 1929, $25 in 1933, and $32.50 now."
San Francisco,D4,NA,D,"This area of some 43 blocks is undulating in topography and is situated on the border of the business district. It is immediately south of the densely populated D-3 area from which there is a constant threat of undesirable racial infiltration. However, there are no concentrations existing at the present time. Inhabitants of the area consist largely of small business men, ""white collar"" workers, skilled and semi-skilled artisans etc., having incomes ranging from $1200 to $3000. There are very few single-family residences in the area which is zoned second-residential and business. Improvements consist largely of middle-class apartments and flats with a strong tendency toward a better grade of apartment houses. In the area is located one of the State Normal Schools, and the new U.S. Mint is also under construction. The single-family residences in the area are from 40 to 50 years old, and had a cost range when new of from $3500 to $7500. They are 70% owner-occupied with a 5% vacancy. Schools, transportation facilities, and recreational areas are favorably located, and its nearness to the shopping centers is also an advantage. The area is 100% developed and a high assessed value of lands would seem to preclude any new construction of single-family residences. But very few mortgagee institutions will consider loans on one to four-family units, and any such loans would be hazardous except upon the basis of land value. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $4500 in 1929, $3000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3750. The same home would have rented for $45 in 1929, $30 in 1933, and $37.50 now."
San Francisco,D5,NA,D,"This area of some 73 blocks surrounds Russian Hill on three sides, and contains a heterogeneous mixture of industry, business, hotels, apartments, and flats, with a generous sprinkling of old residences many of which are in use as boarding or lodging houses. Much of the northern and eastern section is given over to business and industry. The southwestern section contains a large part of what is known as Nob Hill which is occupied by many high-grade apartment houses, hotels, etc. The far-famed Chinatown of San Francisco adjoins this area on the east and southeast, but owing to the topography this is not thought to constitute an undue threat. This area suffered the heaviest damage in the City at the time of the earthquake and fire of 1906 and has been practically all rebuilt since that time. This is a distinctly Italian area insofar as one to four-family units are concerned, and many of the old Italian families have homes here. Single-family residences have an average age of 25 years and are valued at from $4,000 to $15,000 being 75% owner-occupied with a very few vacancies. The area is 95% developed and there is a distinct threat of encroachment by business and apartment houses. Schools of all grades are conveniently near, and transportation facilities are excellent. It also has the advantage of being near the business and shopping centers. High assessment values makes single-family residential ownership a burden, and none of the mortgagee institutions entertain applications for loans on one to four-family units in this area except in the extreme northern part and then upon very much modified terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6500 in 1929, $5,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5750. The same home would have rented for $65 in 1929, $45 in 1933, and $55 now."
San Francisco,D6,NA,D,"This area is made up of low rolling hills with gentle slopes. There are approximately 65 blocks contained therein, which are 60% built-up. The inhabitants consist of laborers, factory workers, and ""white collar"" workers, with an income range of from $1200 to $2,000. No racial concentrations exist, no is there any threat of such a condition in the future; however, many of the inhabitants are of foreign extraction and belong to the so-called lower levels of society. Maintenance is fair in the certain spots in the area, but, generally speaking, there is but little pride of ownership in evidence. Development in this area has been slow and undirected and has extended over the past 30 years. The improvements are a heterogeneous mixture of single-and multi-family, low-cost homes and bungalows, constructed of frame, shingle and stucco, and having a cost range of from $2,000 to $4,000, and an average age of 20 years. This area is zoned first-residential, with the exception of a strop along Capitol and Plymoth Streets which is zoned for business. Homes are approximately 80% owner-occupied, 15% rented, and 5% vacant. Schools of all grades and transportation facilities are conveniently available. Balboa Pakr joins the area on the north, and Ocean View Playgrounds is in the area, both of which add to desirability. However, a gravel pit and car barns which adjoin on the northeast, and the railroad spur tracks which bound and traverse the area constitute detrimental influences. Newer construction is of a better quality than the older improvements, and an upward trend is indicated. Demand for property in this location is limited and mortgagee officials express the belief that while good loans can be made in the area on modified terms, great care should be exercised in making commitments. A standard six room house in this area would have sold for $4750 in 1929, $3500 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4,000. The same home would have rented for $45 in 1929, $32.50 in 1933, and $40 now. "
San Francisco,D7,NA,D,"This area consists of approximately 35 blocks and is 75% built-up. It is of a generally rolling topography, sloping to the southeast and having some hills and bluffs in the northern part. The inhabitants are, for the most part, laborers and factory workers, with some skilled artisans, and the income range is from $1,000 to $2500. There are no racial concentrations but the majority of those dwellings within the area are of the lower social strata. Maintenance is generally only fair, but certain individual properties evidence some pride of ownership. The area is 35 years old and is still developing. The improvements are a heterogeneous mixture of single and multi-family residences of varied types of construction and architectural design. A few fractional blocks in the southeastern part are zoned for business, and the rest of the area is zoned first-residential. The area is 75% owner-occupied, with approximately 3% vacancies. Schools of all grades, parks, and recreational areas are conveniently located, but transportation facilities are only fair. The climatic condition is good. There is evidence of an upward trend in this area, as newer construction is of distinctly better quality. Mortgagee officials are of the opinion that good loans upon modified terms may be made in the area if care is exercised. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5,000 in 1929, $3750 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4250. The same home would have rented for $47.50 in 1929, $35.00 in 1933, and $40,00 now."
San Francisco,D8,NA,D,"This area of some 60 blocks which are 95% built-up lies to the west of Valencia Street and is part of what is known as the Mission District. It has comparatively level topography. The area as a whole is 45 years old, and its inhabitants include people from almost every stratum of society. It is occupied by laborers and factory workers with incomes of from $1000 to $2000 and by ""white collar"" workers, city employees, and shop-keepers with incomes ranging from $1500 to $3,000. There is no racial concentration, but people of Irish extract might be said to predominate. There is no immediate threat of undesirable racial infiltration but such an eventually is distinctly possible. Maintenance in the area is extremely varied and spotted. Some of the intermingling blocks show distinct pride of ownership, while others are indicative of slum conditions. Single-family residences range in value all the way from $2,000 to $7500, and consist of varied types of architecture and construction. The area is zoned second-residential but many blocks are given over to business. Multi-family dwellings, flats and apartments abound throughout the area, and that part lying north of 18th Street might almost be classed ""commercial"" as it contains but few single-family dwellings and a large percentage is given over to business; many shops, markets, and stores, and a few semi-industrial establishments being located here. Single-family dwellings are 70% owner-occupied with about 25% tenancy, and 5% vacancy. Schools and transportation facilities are conveniently available, and parks and recreational areas are near. The Mission Dolores, one of the oldest structures in the City, is located in this area. Climatic conditions in this section are the most equitable in the City, and many residents will live in no other section. Officials of mortgagee institutions are very favorably disposed toward the Mission District of which this area is a part. However, it is very generally recognized that each application must be judged upon the merits of the sectary offer, and terms modified accordingly. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $6,000 in 1929, $4,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $5,000. The same home would have rented for $55 in 1929, $37.50 in 19333, and $45 now."
San Francisco,D9,NA,D,"This area of 36 blocks occupies a fairly level vale with rising topography surrounding it. It is approximately 85% built-up and is largely inhabited by ""white collar"" workers, laborers, factory workers, etc. having incomes ranging from $1,000 to $2400. There are no racial concentrations, and foreign infiltration is felt to be remote. Maintenance is generally mediocre, but certain spots in the area evidence a fair pride of ownership. This district is approximately 40 years old and has had an intermittent development. The improvements range from new to the age of the area and consist of various and sundry types of houses, bungalows, flats and apartments. The single-family residences are valued at from $3,000 to $6,000 and are 75% owner-occupied, with 23% tenancies and 2% vacancies. The area is zoned  second-residential with a few blocks permitting business structures which are occupied by shops and markets. Schools and transportation facilities, parks, and playgrounds are all conveniently available. Mortgagee officials quite generally recognize that while safe loans may be made in the area, great care must be exercised. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5,000 in 1929, $3,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4,000. The same home would have rented for $50 in 1929, $30 in 1933, and $40 now."
San Francisco,D10,NA,D,"This area of 25 blocks is known as Holly Park Circle and occupies a gentle slope running generally from east to west. It is approximately 85% built-up, and the inhabitants consist of small business men, ""white collar"" employees, skilled artisans, and service employees, having incomes ranging from $1,000 to $2500. There are no racial concentrations at present, and threat of infiltration is remote. Maintenance in general denotes pride of ownership. The area as a whole is approximately 40 years old, and the improvements range in age from 10 to 40 years. The dwellings consist of single-family, row and detached, frame and stucco houses and bungalows, with a few flats and apartments, and the cost range of single-family dwellings is from $2500 to $5,000. The area is zoned second-residential with a few blocks on the outskirts given over to neighborhood shops and markets. Single-family dwellings are 80% owner-occupied, 23% rented, and 2% vacant. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas are all conveniently available, and splendid climatic conditions prevail. Holly Park, including one of the city's reservoirs, is within the confines of the area. This district would have been accorded a higher grading had it not been for the undesirable influences of the areas which surround it on the northwest and east, and from which there is an infiltration of lower income groups. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5,000 in 1929, $3,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4,000. The same home would have rented for $50 in 1929, $30 in 1933, and $40 now."
San Francisco,D11,NA,D,"This large, irregularly-shaped area of some 130 blocks has a generally undulating topography and is 70% developed. It might well be called the ""Little Europe"" of San Francisco, as it is occupied very largely by second-generation representatives of all European nations, (Italians predominating), who are employed as laborers, factory workers, and service group employees with incomes ranging from $800 to $2,000. The names of the streets are a fair index of the cosmopolitan character of its inhabitants. The population is thought to be more or less stationary and in many ways exhibit characteristics indicative of pride of ownership. A heterogeneous development has existed in this area over the past 35 years. Dwellings consist of single and multi-family, row houses and bungalows of many types of architecture and construction, having a cost range of from $1500 to $5,000 when new. The area is zoned first residential, with fractional blocks along Mission, Brazil, and Russia Streets reserved for business. The homes are 75% owner-occupied, 20% rented and 5% vacant. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks, and recreational areas are all conveniently available, and general climatic conditions are favorable. There is evidence that this district may develop into a higher grading. Some mortgagee institutions do not include the area in their lending territory, but a majority will receive applications and make loans upon variously modified terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $4250 in 1929, $3000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3750. The same home would have rented for $42.50 in 1929, $27.50 in 1933, and $37.50 now."
San Francisco,D12,NA,D,"This area of some 75 blocks is 95% built-up and occupies a flat region between the slopes of Potrero Hills and the Twin Peaks. It was one of the exclusive districts in San Francisco's early history, some of the old mansions still being used for institutional purposes and lodging houses. It is now largely inhabited by factory workers and laborers, with incomes ranging from $800 to $2400. Many nationalities are represented, but there is no racial concentration, in broad sense of the term. Maintenance is what would naturally be expected in a low-income community. The area is from 50 to 60 years old, and improvements consist of an inharmonious conglomeration of old houses, bungalows, flats, and apartments, sprinkled with shops, markets, and small industrial establishments. Single-family dwellings, aside from old shacks, have a cost range of from $2500 to $5,000. They consist mainly of frame, row single and multi-family dwellings ranging in age from 8 to 60 years many of them being of the old mansion type. The area is principally zoned second-residential, but many blocks are given over to business and light industry. The single-family units are 50% owner-occupied, 45% rented, and 5% vacant. School and transportation facilities, together with parks, and recreational areas, are conveniently available. Two factors which constitute detrimental influences are the packing house district which is not far to the eastward and a Southern Pacific Railroad spur track which transverses the area. This area is in the sunshine zone, and climatic conditions are good. Owing to its decadent condition few mortgagee institutions will entertain applications for residential loans in this area. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5,000 in 1929, $3,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4,000. The same home would have rented for $50 in 1929, $22.50 in 1933, and $40 now."
San Francisco,D13,NA,D,"This is a large area of some 150 blocks which is built around and upon the slopes of what is known as Bernal Heights which has an elevation of 250 feet. The northern part of this area is probably not more than 50% occupied, but the southern part is probably 95% built-up. It is inhabited largely by factory workers, and laborers with incomes ranging from $800 to $2400. Many nationalities are represented, but there is no inharmonious racial concentration. Maintenance is spotted and while a fair degree of pride of ownership is noticeable many of the home are unkempt. The area is some 50 years of age, and has been developing slowly and in a hetero generous manner. The improvements largely consist of small homes of various ages with a cost range of from $2,000 to $3500. It is zoned second-residential with some provision for business. There is a high percentage of owner-occupancy probably as much as 75% with approximately 5% vacancy. School and transportation facilities, parks and recreational areas are conveniently available. It adjoins an industrial area on the east which contains the Packing House District. The prevailing winds, however, are from the west which minimizes the odors. The climate in this area is one of the best in the City. Many of the mortgagee institutions exclude this area from their renting territory, but it is believed that sound loans may be made in the area on modified terms if care is exercised. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $4250 in 1929, $3,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3750. The same home would have rented for $40 in 1929, $27.50 in 1933, and $35 now."
San Francisco,D14,NA,D,"This area contains some 40 blocks and is about 50% built-up. It has a slightly undulating topography which is favorable to residential development, and it is inhabited largely by skilled and semi-skilled factory workers and artisans, having incomes ranging from $800 to $2400. The area presents no racial problems, and maintenance shows pride of ownership. Its improvements are largely single-family row and detached, frame and stucco cottages and bungalows, having a cost range of $2,000 to $5,000 and an average age of from 12 to 30 years. The area is zoned first-residential but contains some multi-family flats. The single-family dwellings are 80% owner-occupied, and there are but few vacancies. Schools of all grades, transportation facilities, parks and recreational areas are all conveniently available. Light industrial areas adjoin on the south and southeast in San Mateo County and the proposed but as yet unimproved John McLaren Park adjoins on the west. Part of this area might have been accorded a ""low yellow"" grading were it not for the threat of industrial development on its border. Some mortgagee institutions do not include this area in their lending territory and all of them are inclined to be conservative in their attitude toward applications. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $2450 in 1929, $3,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3500. The same home would have rented for $40 in 1929, $27.50 in 1933, and $32.50 now."
San Francisco,D15,NA,D,"This area of some 60 blocks is located in what is known as the Potrero District and occupies a hill of approximately 200 feet elevation, which divides to make the two northern wings of the area. Some portions of the area are high and comparatively level, affording excellent view locations. The approaches to the area are steep, and it contains a number of sheer bluffs. The area is 75% built-up, and the inhabitants, with few exceptions, are of the working class -- factory workers, laborers, and artisans, with incomes of from $1,000 to $2,000. There is quite a concentration of ""red"" Russians and other foreign elements in the area. Improvements consist of row single-family dwellings of frame and stucco construction, valued at from $2500 to $5500. The district is 50 years old and is still developing; consequently dwellings run from new to the age of the district. The area is 80% owner-occupied, with few vacancies, and a fair degree of maintenance was observed in a considerable part of the area. The zoning is second-residential, and the topography also offers protection from unfavorable encroachments. Schools of all grades are conveniently available, two schools being located within the area; transportation facilities are also good, and recreational areas are provided by the three playfields which adjoin the area. Light and heavy industrial districts completely surround the area, and stockyards meat packing plants situated nearby are the source of unpleasant odors when the wind is from their direction, which, fortunately is seldom. A railroad tunnel runs under part of the area. The best climatic conditions in San Francisco are said to exist in this area. The area is said to offer some interesting possibilities for future development, but under existing conditions loan commitments are made with extreme care by the comparatively few mortgagee institutions which will lend at all in the area. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $5,000 in 1929, $3,000 in 1933, and is currently selling for $4,000. The same home would have rented for $47.50 in 1929, $30.00 in 1933 and $37.50 now."
San Francisco,D16,NA,D,"This area of some 75 blocks contains numerous hills which have many short but sharp inclines and low-laying but steep bluffs. The streets are platted to overcome this topographical disadvantage. The population of the area, while quite stable, is composed of lower-income groups, being largely ""white collar"" and factory workers in the industrial districts which adjoins the area on the north, south, and east, whose incomes range from $1,000 to $2400. While many of the inhabitants are of foreign extraction, no racial problem is presented, and the likelihood of any is considered remote. The area, which has been developing in a heterogeneous manner over the past 45 years, is still less than 60% built-up. The improvements consist largely of row and detached, frame and stucco single-family dwellings of various types and styles, having a cost range of from $2,000 to $5,000. Owner-occupancy is high, being 85% with few vacancies. Maintenance, while spotted, is in general fairly satisfactory. The zoning is largely first-residential, with a few scattered blocks given over to neighborhood shops and markets. The topography is also a protection from undesirable encroachment, and a further protection is afforded by the large undeveloped area adjoining on the southeast which is zoned first-residential. School, transportation, and recreational facilities are all conveniently available. Occasional winds from the northeast bring obnoxious odors from stockyards and packing plants located in that direction. While a few mortgagee institutions consider it possible to make safe loans in the area, they are very careful as to moral risks and conservative as to terms. "
San Francisco,D17,NA,D,"The southern part of this area of approximately 100 blocks consists of low-lying hills, the northern and central part of gentle slopes, and the eastern section is comparatively level. Topographically, this should be set up as three areas, but other wise the area is comparatively uniform in character. The population is made up of factory workers, skilled and semi-skilled laborers and artisans, with incomes ranging from $800 to $2400. There are no racial problems, and possibility of any is considered remote. Maintenance, while spotted, shows a degree of pride of ownership. The district has slowly developed over the past 30 years, and though continuing to show activity, is still only 60 to 65% built-up. Improvements consist of varying styles and types of row and detached, frame and stucco, one and two-story single-family dwellings, the average age being 10 to 35 years. There is an 80% owner-occupancy and about 3% vacancy. The area is zoned first-residential with provision for neighborhood trading centers. Primary grade schools are located in the district, but high school facilities are some distance away. Park and recreational area are nearby, but part of the area lacks adequate transportation. With the development of McLaren Park, this adverse factor will probably cease to exist. While proximity to industrial district and low level of income and improvements, together with other handicaps, preclude a higher rating than has been given, there are indications that parts of the area may develop into higher grades. Climatic conditions in the area are excellent. There is a wide diversity of opinion among officials of mortgagee institutions regarding this area. A few do not include the area in their lending territory, while others viewing the area from its natural advantages and future possibilities are inclined to be generous in their terms where improvements are in keeping with the district. Generally speaking, loans are made in the area upon modified terms. A standard six-room house in this area would have sold for $4500 in 1929, $3250 in 1933, and is currently selling for $3750. The same income would have rented for $48.50 in 1929, $30 in 1933, and $37.50 now. "
