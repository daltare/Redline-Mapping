NOTE: CalEPA site data and regulatory data (inspections, violations, enforcement actions, and site program types) from the CalEPA Regulated Sites Portal goes in this folder (I haven't yet figured out a way to get an automated update of this data) -- the portal is at:
https://siteportal.calepa.ca.gov/nsite/map/export

Manually download and unzip the following datasets to this folder:
- Site (file = Site.csv)
- Site Regulated Programs (file = SiteEI.csv )
- Evaluations (file = Evaluations.csv) # this is the inspections data
- Violations (file = Violations.csv)
- Enforcements (file = EA.csv)
